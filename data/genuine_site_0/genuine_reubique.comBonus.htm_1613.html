<p>Fred Larimore of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania performed the
majority of the research for this project, work that was
instigated by his acquisition of General Bonus&#146;s Afghanistan
1878 medal. Most of the words in this narrative are Fred&#146;s.
I have added to it in places and modified it somewhat to my own
writing style, but in essence it is still Fred Larimore&#146;s
work.</p>

<p>Fred originally owned General Bonus&#146;s Afghanistan 1878
medal before I acquired it from him. The whereabouts of the
General&#146;s only other medal, the Indian Mutiny medal with
clasp [CENTRAL INDIA], is not known. I have added an unnamed
Mutiny medal to his Afghanistan medal to complete the group of
the only medals or decorations ever awarded to him. It was the
Afghanistan Medal, however, that started Fred on his research and
it was that medal that was the basis for this story of the life
and military career of Major General Joseph Bonus.</p>

<p>The information presented in this narrative has been taken
from the many sources listed in the Reference section at the end.
Bonus's movements during the time of the Indian Mutiny have been
compiled primarily from campaign and unit histories. A detailed,
day by day accounting of his service with the Central India Field
Force between the 10<sup>th</sup> of January and the 14<sup>th</sup>
of July 1858 is given in his letters written to his parents.
These letters were copied from the India Office Library and are
in the author&#146;s possession. Excerpts from the letters are
included in this narrative; however, they are much too lengthy to
include in their entirety. They do make fascinating reading and
provide an excellent account of Bonus&#146;s deeds as well as the
work done by the Sappers and Miners during the campaign. The
letters also provide graphic detail of some of the horrors of the
Mutiny and the hardships associated with service in central India
at that time. </p>

<p>As I worked on this narrative of Major General Bonus&#146;s
life, I could not help but wonder about why he was never awarded
any orders or decorations during his period of military service.
Bonus served for 31 years, from 1855 to 1886. He was a daring
young officer during the Indian Mutiny, one who was eager to see
action and who, indeed, was frequently at the forefront of the
action. He was mentioned in despatches on numerous occasions and
was thought highly of by his fellow officers. His served his
Queen, the Colours, the Corps of Royal Engineers and the Bombay
Sappers and Miners faithfully and with distinction for all those
years and yet, he was never honored with the Distinguished
Service Order or any of the other military orders of knighthood.
One gets the impression that because he spent his entire career
in India that he may not been considered one of the inner circle
of the elite who ran the British Army during the last half of the
19<sup>th</sup> Century. He appears to have been one of those
hard working officers who had no &quot;godfather&quot; in the War
Office to look out for him. He does not appear to have been in
favour with those who could recommend him for honours and awards
for his service. It is also likely that since he spent so many
years in India on railroad construction duties, he was overlooked
by those who could be in a position to bestow honours upon him.
He did rise to the rank of Major General, so his period of long
service did not go completely unrewarded. It is rather
mystifying, however, that such a long-serving officer would only
have been entitled to two campaign medals after 31 years of
service. </p>

<p align="center"><b>2. </b><b><u>EARLY LIFE AND FAMILY
INFORMATION</u></b></p>

<p>Joseph Bonus was born in London on the 14th of September 1836
[1]. His parents were John and Elizabeth Ann Bonus, of
&quot;Point House&quot;, Blackheath, London. Joseph was their
fifth son. His father was a merchant whose business was located
at 81 Gracechurch Street in London, located just north of the
River Thames and east of the Whitechapel District of London.</p>

<p>Joseph was baptized at St. Mary Stratford Bow [2], Middlesex,
on the 7th of December 1836. This Parish is bounded on the east
by the River Lea, which forms in this direction a line of
separation between the Counties of Middlesex and Essex. On the
north the Parish borders Hackney and Bethnal Green, on the west
and southwest it is bounded by the Parish of Stepney, of which it
was once a part, and on the southwest it abuts the Parish of St.
Leonard Bromley. The Parish of St. Mary Stratford Bow is part of
the archdiocese of Middlesex and the diocese of London and the
major religions in the Parish are Baptist, Wesleyan and
Methodists [3].</p>

<p>The Bonus residence in Blackheath was located on the south
side of the River Thames just below Woolwich. St. Mary Stratford
Bow was located on the north side of the river, about a mile to
the north of Blackheath. No reason has been uncovered to explain
why the parents of Joseph Bonus would have chosen the Parish of
St. Mary Stratford Bow for the christening of their son. </p>

<p align="center"><b>3. </b><b><u>EDUCATION [4]</u></b></p>

<p>Joseph Bonus received his education in mathematics and the
classics at Dr. Grieg&#146;s School in Walthamstow. After ample
preparation at Dr. Grieg&#146;s School, he applied for admission
to Addiscombe on the 17th of November 1852. He was recommended by
his father John Bonus and nominated by John Masterman, Esq. His
Cadet Papers while he was at Addiscombe contain a letter of
reference from his teacher at Dr. Grieg&#146;s School, dated the
15th of November 1852, expressing his entire satisfaction with
Bonus&#146;s academic work and with his character and conduct.
Bonus passed his entrance examination on the 3rd of December 1852
and entered Addiscombe in 1853, just shortly after Lord Roberts
left the school for his famous &quot;41 years in India.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1798 the Honourable East India Company began to send cadets
to the Royal Military Academy to train as officers in the Indian
artillery and engineers. In 1809 the Company set up a military
seminary at Addiscombe House in Croydon based upon the
organization of the Royal Military Academy. After the Indian
Mutiny of 1857-1858 it was decided that for security reasons, all
artillery and engineers in India should be a part of the British
Army. The establishment of the Royal Artillery and Royal
Engineers was increased accordingly. Addiscombe was closed and
its functions were undertaken by an enlarged Royal Military
Academy. Joseph Bonus attended Addiscombe very near the end of
its existence. </p>

SERVICE</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Commissioning, Training and Posting to
India (1855-1857)</u></b></p>

<p>Cadet Joseph Bonus successfully completed his work at
Addiscombe and was granted a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in
the Royal (Bombay) Engineers on the 8th of June 1855. Other young
officers of his batch commissioned in the Bombay Engineers on the
same day included [5]:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant Charles Augustus Goodfellow
    (later Lieutenant General Goodfellow, <b><i>V.C</i></b><i>.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant Charles Hancock (died at Kotah
    on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 1858 from a wound received on
    the 30<sup>th</sup> of March in the assault on Kotah)</p>
    <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant Hugh Brownlow Matthew-Lannowe
    (later Major General)</p>
    <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant Edward Parry Gambier (later

</blockquote>

<p>After graduation from Addiscombe, Bonus reported to the School
of Military Engineering at Chatham, Kent, where he underwent two
additional years of training to prepare him for service as an
engineer officer. From Chatham he was posted to the Headquarters
of the Bombay Sappers and Miners at Poona in India, arriving
there in February of 1857. At Poona 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant
Bonus was assigned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Company, Bombay Sappers
and Miners commanded by 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant H.R.
Meiklejohn. Meiklejohn also had been commissioned from
Addiscombe, but as his date of commissioning was the 9<sup>th</sup>
of December 1854 he had seniority over Bonus although they were
both just 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenants. </p>

<p>After only three months at Poona Bonus was ordered to active
service against the rebels of the Bengal Army, a rebellion that
began at Meerut on the 11th of May 1857. Lieutenant Bonus left
Poona in command of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Company, Bombay Sappers
and Miners along with Lieutenant C.A. Goodfellow, a brother
subaltern, who had been with him at Addiscombe and Chatham. Bonus
and his company marched off to join in the fighting against the
rebels with Major General Sir Hugh Rose&#146;s Central India
Field Force.</p>

<p>Bonus first traveled to Ahmednagar where he stayed some days
awaiting orders. He and his company were then directed to join
the Nerbudha Field Force at Aurungabad, which was under the
command of Colonel C. Stewart of the 14<sup>th</sup> Dragoons.
Soon after joining at Aurungabad, Bonus was appointed Assistant
Field Engineer in addition to retaining command of his company.
He and his company were under canvas throughout the rains of 1857
and despite having a very wet time he enjoyed life with
excursions to Daulatabad, the caves of Ellora and other places of
interest. In additions to sight-seeing, Bonus also had plenty of
shooting and pig-sticking to keep him busy. Additionally, there
was much for him to see in Aurungabad where there were some fine
ancient ruins. He also got to visit the mausoleum of
Aurungzebe&#146;s wife, constructed in the style of the Taj Mahal
at Agra [6].</p>

<p>At the end of the rainy season it was possible for the troops
to move and the field force left Aurungabad and marched steadily
to Sehore over very bad roads, arriving there in January of 1858.
No rebel opposition was encountered during the march. Lieutenant
Bonus moved a day in advance of the main body of the field force
leaving the majority of his baggage behind. During the advance to
Sehore he slept on the ground night after night without a tent.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Disarming the Bhopal Contingent, 7
January 1858 [7]</u></b></p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonus&#146;s first assignment with the Central
India Field Force was the disarming of the Bhopal contingent.
Bonus wrote about this episode in his own diary, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;As I command the sappers and miners I went to
        a council to discuss the disarming. About 7.30 a.m. of
        the 8</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>, the infantry and
        cavalry of the Bhopal contingent were ordered to march
        through the camp, to the surprise of those not in the
        secret. The dragoons and the artillery were at the
        stables, and the 3</i><sup><i>rd</i></sup><i> and 24</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
        were strolling about. But no sooner were the contingent
        gentlemen clear of camp than a change came very rapidly
        over the scene. In a few minutes the dragoons were
        mounted and the guns horsed. The infantry</i> <i>fell in
        armed with ball. Great must have been the surprise of the
        late mutineers to see cavalry, guns and infantry between
        them and their village.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The contingent infantry were ordered to pile arms;
        which they did. They were then marched some fifty yards
        from their arms, and the 3</i><sup><i>rd</i></sup><i>
        Europeans marched up to the piles. Next the cavalry were
        ordered to dismount, when their horses were led away. But
        these men on being ordered to give up their swords,
        refused. Mayne asked for a company of Europeans to compel
        obedience. But the brigadier said, &#145;I&#146;ll give
        you something better than that.&quot; He at once ordered
        the artillery to prepare for action in front of the
        dismounted men. &#145;Trot, march&#146; &#150;
        &#145;action right&#146; &#150; &#145;with grape
        load!&#146; No sooner was the order given than the
        mutineers put down their swords. Each man had his uniform
        stripped off.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b><u>Siege And Capture Of Rhatghur, 24-28
January 1858 [8]</u></b></p>

<p>Major General Sir Hugh Rose, having learned that a strong body
of mutineers was approaching Saugor, determined to march to its
relief. 2nd Lieutenant Bonus and 2nd Lieutenant H.R. Meiklejohn,
along with the 2nd and 5<sup>th</sup> Companies of the Bombay
Sappers and Miners, arrived on the scene before the main body of
Sir Hugh&#146;s field force. Sir Hugh marched from Mhow with the
2nd Brigade under Brigadier Charles Steuart, late 14th Light
Dragons on the 6th of January 1858. The letters of Lieutenant
Bonus written to his parents indicate that the field force was at
Sehore on the 10<sup>th</sup> of January and at Panda on the 16<sup>th</sup>
of January. </p>

<p>2nd Lieutenant Bonus participated from the 24th to the 28th of
January 1858 in the siege and capture of this rock fortress on
the River Bina, which blocked Sir Hugh&#146;s advance to Saugor.
The rock was a mile and a half in length and was covered and
surrounded by thick jungle. To the north lay the town. The west
side of the rock was along the river and was very steep and
unapproachable. The east side was accessible and this is the side
on which Sir Hugh established his attack. On the evening of the
27th Captain Lightfoot, Bombay Artillery and Lieutenant Bonus
were detailed by Sir Hugh to investigate a low massive tower
close to the main gate of the fort. After a thorough examination
of the tower was completed Captain Lightfoot and Lieutenant Bonus
reported that the &quot;massive construction and nature of its
defenses prevented it being used for the offensive&quot;. After
this report Sir Hugh withdrew his troops from this area of the
fort, except for the artillery and its support troops, which were
in place to fire on the outer wall and eastern curtain of the
fort. Sir Hugh ordered the artillery to open fire early on the
28th. The fire was so effective that it was evident that a breach
would soon be made. This fact, combined with the several sharp
engagements with the enemy in and around the town of Rhatghur,
apparently convinced the enemy of the prudence of withdrawal. It
was discovered in the morning of the 28th that the rebels had
deserted the fortress. Sir Hugh left the 24th Bombay Native
Infantry, some guns, and some cavalry to protect Rhatghur and
continued his approach to Saugor after having fought a sharp
action at Barodia on the 31st of January to protect his left
flank. Lieutenant Bonus did not participate in this action. He
was left to blow up the gates at Rhatghur while the field force
marched for Barodia. Bonus wrote the following to his parents
regarding his efforts to blow up the gate:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;My demolitions in the fort were not very
        successful. Goodfellow was with me. We nearly managed to
        demolish ourselves. We made a hole horizontally under the
        rampart, loaded it with a heavy charge, but time being
        short, had rather scamped the tamping. G. and I luckily
        took refuge behind a dwarf wall. When the explosion took
        place the tamping which consisted mainly of stones, shot
        out and pelted the small wall behind which we were
        crouched. But we made a fine smash of the Main Gate,
        wrecking the whole place.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Bonus and his men left Rhatghur on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of
February and on the 3rd of February 1858 Saugor was relieved.
Lieutenant Bonus had provided Sir Hugh with useful intelligence
on the nature of the fort&#146;s defenses and he was to find his
name Mentioned in Despatches after his first engagement of the
Indian Mutiny<font size="2">.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Capture Of The Fort Of Garrakota <br>
And The Action At The Pass Of Maddenpore, End Of February 1858
[9]</u></b></p>

<p>Sir Hugh determined to continue his easterly march toward the
strong fort of Garrakota. This fort blocked the advance to
Jhansi, which Sir Hugh had now been ordered to move on as quickly
as possible in order to help open the Grand Trunk Road from
Bombay to Agra.</p>

<p>A detachment of the Bombay Sappers and Miners was attached to
the 2nd Brigade of Sir Hugh&#146;s Central India Field Force
under the command of Brigadier C. Steuart. Sir Hugh ordered this
Brigade to capture the fort at Garrakota and to take control of
the difficult passes in the mountainous region that separated the
Shaghur and Saugor Districts.</p>

<p>The mutineers under the command of the Rajah of Sharghur held
the fort at Garrakota but left without much of a fight on the
12th of February 1858 when confronted by the 2nd Brigade, which
had marched 28 miles from Saugor. The 2nd Brigade then returned
to Saugor leaving the Bombay Sappers and Miners to destroy as
much of the fort&#146;s defenses as possible. The detachment
returned to Saugor on the 13th of February after the demolition
had been completed.</p>

<p>After supplies had been received for his forces at Saugor on
the 27th of February, Sir Hugh decided his attack should be
directed on the Maddenpore pass. The Bombay Sappers and Miners
were attached to the center of Sir Hugh&#146;s Force. It was soon
clear that the rebels intended to contest the capture of the
pass. Enemy skirmishers fired on the advance well in front of the
entrance to the pass and the enemy was also seen to be massing on
the hills to the left, some 800 yards from the entrance. Sir Hugh
ordered the rapid movement of cavalry with horse artillery
support to clear the hills and glens of the pass with sweeping
actions to the left and right of the pass. These actions were to
be mopped up and reinforced by the following infantry support of
which the Bombay Sappers and Miners with Lieutenant Bonus were a
part.</p>

<p>The fighting was sharp at times, but in general the Rajah of
Sharghur&#146;s rebels were easily brushed aside. This was
probably owing to the good practice of the artillery and
effective cavalry sweeps. The pass was taken with only 12 men
being wounded, none of them in the Bombay Sappers and Miners.
After the pass was secured the Bombay Sappers and Miners
participated in the demolition of several forts in the area of
the pass and then moved on to Murrowra, arriving there on the 8<sup>th</sup>
of March. They then moved on to Banpoor on the 11<sup>th</sup> of
March and were encamped on the River Betwa by the 19<sup>th</sup>
of March.</p>

<p>The majority of the country to the East of the River Betwa
between Saugor and Jhansi, which had been controlled by the
rebels since the outbreak of the rebellion, was now restored to
the Government of India by the middle of March 1858. The fortress
of Jhansi was the next objective.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Siege And Storming Of Jhansi, 22
March - 3 April 1858 [10,11]</u></b></p>

<p>Preliminary to, and in preparation for the siege and storming
of Jhansi, Sir Hugh employed Major Boileau, Lieutenant
Prendergast, Madras Engineers (later severely wounded at Betwa),
and 2nd Lieutenant Bonus in a reconnaissance of Jhansi. The day
was exceedingly hot, but the collection of information was
critical. The reconnaissance party left the camp east of Jhansi
and proceeded to collect information around Jhansi to the
northwest where they were to meet Sir Hugh on a certain
predetermined hill. As they approached the General and his staff
with its dragoon escort, they noticed a horseman approaching from
the west who suddenly turned and fled. What ensued was a fine
chase over &quot;good sporting ground,&quot; but it was baked
hard and the engineers saw eight horses and their riders go down.
It was soon determined that the rider was an orderly from Major
Orr&#146;s camp and had been sent with a despatch for the general
and was not expecting to see dragoons; hence, he thought they
were the enemy. Later, after the excitement was over, the report
on the findings of the reconnaissance of Jhansi was presented to
Sir Hugh. </p>

<p>The Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief had recognized
that Jhansi presented difficulties of a most formidable nature,
and discretion had been given to Sir Hugh to pass it by merely
leaving a force to observe it. But Sir Hugh believed that to pass
Jhansi would be fatal to British prestige, while on the other
hand capture of the famous city would be a crushing blow to the
rebel hopes. It says much for the character and daring of Sir
Hugh Rose that he was preparing to attack the city and fortress
with a force consisting of only two brigades, with full
confidence that he would be successful. An interesting fact
unknown to Sir Hugh at the time of his decision was that the main
fort had one fatal weakness. They would not have faced a siege
for long because they had no water supply and their storage tanks
were empty. If the city defenses were carried, the fortress was
doomed.</p>

<p>The city of Jhansi was protected and commanded by a large fort
that stood on a rock that rose from the plain to the west of the
city. The fort's construction was of massive masonry with granite
walls 10 feet to 12 feet thick. Elaborate outworks and turrets
bearing guns surrounded the main fort. Except for the western
side where the fort rock was an insurmountable barrier, a
continuous wall ran around the city. This wall was 4 1/2 miles
long, 6 feet to 12 feet thick, 18 feet to 30 feet high, and had
flanking bastions throughout its length. The most important
bastion was on the southern portion of the wall where it passed
over a large mound. This bastion was semicircular in shape, armed
with 5 guns, and was protected by a formidable ditch that was
strengthened with masonry. The entire southern front of the wall
was commanded by 27 guns manned by men of the mutinied 4/9 Bengal
Artillery under an expert commander. The rebel garrison at Jhansi
consisted of about 10,000 native levies and 1,500 Bengal sepoys
of whom 400 were cavalry.</p>

<p>Farther to the south of the city wall there rose from the
plain two rocky hillocks. The hillock to the east of the main
bastion was 1,800 yards from the wall, and the one to the west
was 600 yards from the wall. The space between these two hillocks
was filled by a line of 3 lesser mounds of about the same
elevation as the hillocks. This strip of elevated ground was
about to be occupied by Sir Hugh&#146;s Central India Field Force
and 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant Bonus&#146;s company of the Bombay
Sappers and Miners. Bonus and his men would soon find themselves
heavily engaged and in the forefront of the battle after having
just proved their value at the siege and capture of Rhatghur.</p>

<p>Bonus&#146;s company left the camp on the Betwa on the 19<sup>th</sup>
of March to help prepare artillery positions for the siege of
Jhansi. The first batteries were established and fortified by the
Sappers and Miners under the command of Sir Hugh&#146;s Field
Engineer Major Boileau. They opened fire on the 25th of March and
by the 30th had broken an appreciable breach on the west side of
the mound. A timber retrenchment of the breach was destroyed by
red-hot shot, but the expenditure of ammunition in the various
bombardments was so great that it became evident that the city
would have to be taken by storm, a most uninviting prospect.</p>

<p>The assault arrangements were almost complete when a Sapper
observation post spotted the advance of a rebel army. Lieutenant
Prendergast (later General) recounts an interesting incident
involving 2nd Lieutenant Bonus:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Having just come off trench duty on the 31st
        March, I found a rather larger party than usual at the
        mess table, and Lieutenant Bonus entered late, saying,
        &#145;You all seem comfortable. Do you know that there
        are 20,000 of the enemy close by?&#146; He was laughed to
        scorn, but he persisted in the statement, adding that the
        sergeant on Observatory Hill had signaled to
        Head-Quarters, and that he had ridden out with the
        General and seen the enemy.&quot; </i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Prendergast had a lurking suspicion that this was
not a joke and had issued orders for his charger to be ready at a
moments notice (he was to be severely wounded the next day).
There indeed proved to be a force 20,000 strong under the command
of the very capable rebel leader Tantia Topi, who was moving to
relieve the garrison at Jhansi. While maintaining fire on the
city defenses, Sir Hugh moved out to meet the rebel relief force
and soundly defeated them in the brilliant action at the Battle
of Betwa, along the Betwa River, on the 1st of April 1858. During
the battle Sir Hugh was successful in repulsing Tantia
Topi&#146;s force and capturing all of his artillery.</p>

<p>Two days later, after reestablishing his forces before Jhansi,
Sir Hugh issued orders for the storming of the city at dawn on
the 3rd of April 1858. It was decided both brigades would storm
the city. The 1st Brigade, on the left, carried the breach near
the mound and successfully escaladed the wall further to the west
gaining entrance and a foothold in the city. The 2nd Brigade, led
by the ladder and storming parties from the Madras and Bombay
Sappers and Miners, suffered a severe check. Under a devastating
fire, the ladder parties ran forward and planted three ladders on
30-foot high walls, and led by Engineer officers Lieutenant
Meiklejohn, Lieutenant Dick, Lieutenant Fox and Lieutenant Bonus,
the 3rd Bombay European Regiment swarmed up them. Both
Lieutenants Meiklejohn and Dick were killed. Meiklejohn had run
up his ladder, was dragged into the fort, and cut to pieces by
the rebels. Lieutenant Dick was shot while stepping off the
ladder. Fox was shot in the neck at the foot of the ladder, but
survived his wound. Lieutenant Bonus was wounded by being clubbed
by a musket.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonus was sighted in Brigadier Steuart's despatch,
&quot;for the gallant manner in which he led up and maintained
his position on the ladders, until disabled and knocked over by
the blow of a stone.&quot; The frail bamboo ladders, eventually
overloaded with men, broke and dropped the men to the ground.
Thus the first attempt ended in complete disaster.</p>

<p>Bonus describes his participation at Jhansi in detail in his

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;On the night of the 2</i><sup><i>nd</i></sup><i>
        April orders came round very late, but neither Dick nor I
        was detailed for any duty. We both, however, decided that
        we would be in the game somehow.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>3</i><sup><i>rd</i></sup><i> April. At 2.30 a.m.
        the sappers left camp with Brown, Fox, Goodfellow,
        Meiklejohn and Dick. I did not move until 4 a.m. and then
        went down to the right attack, where I found the staff in
        the advanced battery. The ladder party with Fox and Brown
        was just approaching the wall, and it was very plain that
        things were not going well. I ran out and joined the
        party to help as far as I could.</i></p>
        <p><i>Fox and I managed to get a double ladder placed,
        but with much difficulty: for the ground was very rough,
        the wall high, the ladder heavy and too short, and the
        fire of the enemy incessant and well directed.</i></p>
        <p><i>As soon as the ladder was ready, I called to the
        Europeans of the storming party to follow me, and
        mounted: but only one man would at first venture. He and
        I went up side by side on the bamboo double ladder. At
        the top we had an unpleasant time; as many men on the
        wall as could crowd in front of us hacked away at us. But
        they were so anxious to protect themselves with their
        shields that they could hardly see what they were doing:
        my sword was chiefly used to ward off their cuts and I
        was so busy with my right hand that I quite forgot the
        revolver in my left.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The soldier alongside of me used his bayonet
        freely, but I don&#146;t think he did much damage.
        However, this little game soon came to an end. I was
        dimly conscious of a man well to my left who clubbed his
        musket, swung it round his head, and the next instant it
        was fireworks and black night for me.</i></p>
        <p><i>The first thing I realised after I fell was someone
        was standing over me, saying &#145;Poor fellow! he&#146;s
        done for!&#146; However, though I could not move a limb,
        I felt that I was not &#145;done for,&#146; and soon I
        managed to crawl behind a low bit of wall, when I lay
        still till I could look about me.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>I was half-blinded with blood and felt as if every
        bone in my body was broken . . . it was clear that the
        escalade had failed, and that there was very sharp
        fighting going on inside the walls.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The attack was soon reorganized and other ladders were brought
forward only to meet the same fate of the first attack. For a
time it appeared the attack might be completely repulsed. Finally
it was thought that the defense of the wall might be successfully
weakened by spreading it out over eight ladders rather than
three. This tactic allowed the stormers to gain a footing and
rush along the wall, clearing the wall and making contact with
the left attack and coordinating the sweep into the city.</p>

<p>Street fighting continued for several days, with the Sappers
and Miners assisting the infantry by knocking holes in the roofs
of houses and dropping live shells into the rooms. They also
dealt with loop-holed walls and other points of fortification
through out the city. The number in the enemy garrison killed was
placed at about 5,000. On the 5th of April, the main fort was
discovered to be empty, and with its occupation all serious
resistance ended and Jhansi was in British possession.</p>

<p>The Sappers and Miners were lucky in their losses. While they
were closely engaged throughout the siege and capture of Jhansi,
they lost only 4 other ranks killed and 9 wounded. However,
causalities in officers were formidable. Before the battle of
Betwa Major Boileau had 8 British engineer officers under his
command. By the end of the fighting only two remained, with 2
being killed and 4 being wounded (Bonus being one of the
wounded). Lieutenant Prendergast, who was severely wounded at the
battle of Betwa, and unable to participate in the capture of
Jhansi relates the following incident:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;I was too tired to move , could see nothing,
        and there was no one to keep me informed of what was
        going on; it was horribly exciting, listening to the din
        (of battle) which seemed neither to advance nor retire.
        At last an orderly came in to say that, &#145;Lieutenant
        Dick was killed,&#146; immediately afterwards,
        &#145;Lieutenant Meiklejohn killed, Lieutenant Bonus
        killed (actually wounded), Lieutenant Fox killed
        (actually wounded).&#146; All of these were my messmates;
        presently a tall, gaunt figure with a bandaged head, but
        without sword or helmet, walked past my tent door - this
        was my friend Bonus. After a little he came to me with
        broken head and broken knees, full of wrath because he
        had been hit on the head by a stick or a stone,
        &#145;instead of being shot as a soldier should
        be!&#146;[12]. He was leading a party up a ladder, and
        when at the top received the blow that knocked him off,
        and was very fortunate to have no worse injuries than a
        head cut and bruised, a few teeth loosened, and chipped
        knees. However, he explained that when he came down he
        thought he was killed, and lay still till the enemy took
        to throwing stones and other disagreeable things at him,
        then he thought he would try and get up, and found that
        he was able to totter away, though he was half dazed and
        good for nothing.&quot;</i></p>

<p>The Central India Field Force remained at Jhansi for three
weeks for a much needed rest and resupplying of men and
materials. Finally, on the 25th of April 1858 the field force was
again on the move, not only having to deal with the enemy, but
also the major problems created by the severe heat that was
moving onto the plains of India.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Advance On Kunch And The Occupation
Of Poonch, 25 April - 1 May 1858</u></b></p>

<p>Leaving a garrison in Jhansi, Sir Hugh started his march to
the northeast towards Poonch with the 1st Brigade on the night of
the 25th of April 1858. The 2nd Brigade was to follow the 1st
Brigade two days later. These marches were terrible affairs. The
sun was so strong that metal articles became so hot that it was
painful to touch them. Through out these marches the troops
maintained their discipline and toiled onwards, parched by thirst
and suffocated by dust, with many suffering sunstroke. Major
Gall, 14th Hussars was in command of a Field Force Detachment,
including Lieutenant Bonus and 20 Bombay Sappers and Miners,
which pressed on to Poonch ahead of the rest of the force. Major
Gall&#146;s reconnaissance had determined that the rebels were
assembled at Kunch, a town 14 miles distant. Major Gall decided
that the placement of a picket of the Hyderabad Cavalry at
Loharri might prove to be prudent. Loharri, a village 8 miles
northwest of Poonch, contained a fort that was garrisoned by men
of the Rajah of Santhar who had professed loyalty to the
Government. On Major Gall&#146;s departure the garrison betrayed
the picket to the rebels at Kunch but the Hyderabad Cavalry,
being prepared for this, successfully cut their way out of the
rebel attack and returned to Poonch.</p>

<p>2nd Lieutenant Joseph Bonus was promoted to 1st Lieutenant on
the 27th of April 1858 while participating in these operations.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Storming And Capture Of Loharri, 2
May 1858 [13]</u></b></p>

<p>Sir Hugh Rose, determined to make an example of the traitors
of the garrison at Loharri, sent Major Gall&#146;s Field Force
Detachment to invest, storm, and capture the fort on the 2nd of
May 1858. The fort and the village of Loharri were situated on an
extensive level plain with the village and the fort being
separated by a clear space of ground of about 150 yards. The fort
was about 100 yards square and was built of mud and sun-dried
bricks. The fort square was flanked by round towers at the
corners and had a ditch and a second line of works outside of the
ditch.</p>

<p>After attempts were made to induce the garrison into surrender
failed, Major Gall ordered the fort attacked. His artillery was
well placed and easily cleared the enemy from the walls allowing
for the advance of a company of the 3rd Bombay Europeans across
the open space. The company captured a guardhouse, established
themselves at the ditch and opened two undefended gates of the
fort with the enemy having moved behind a strong third gate.
Major Gall&#146;s Despatch written after the operation reports
that:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Lieutenant Bonus, of the Bombay Engineers,
        after a very close reconnaissance, had reported to me the
        extreme difficulty of taking the place by escalade.
        Nothing then remained, in my opinion, but to blow open
        the third gate with a bag of gunpowder, and carry the
        fort by storm. By good luck a gunsmith&#146;s shop had
        been discovered in the village, and in it an old pair of
        forge bellows. Lieutenant Bonus borrowing fifty pounds of
        powder from the artillery (which they were not going to
        get back), soon converted this into a very efficient
        powder-bag.&quot; </i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Gall&#146;s Despatch continues that under the cover of a
false attack to the south side of the fort, </p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Lieutenant Bonus, under the cover of a sharp
        fire from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in
        front of the closed gate - a strong wooden one with iron
        spikes - the small piece of portfire was lighted, and the
        firing party withdrew. After about a minute and a half
        the explosion took place.&quot;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The gate was demolished and the stormers immediately came face
to face with the enemy and a desperate hand to hand combat
commenced for control of the gateway. The initial stormers
reinforced by the columns behind eventually gained control of the
fort.</p>

<p>Major Gall&#146;s concluding remarks in his Despatch state
that: </p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;The readiness of resource evidenced by
        Lieutenant Bonus will, I feel, be appreciated by the
        Major General. I can further bear witness to the coolness
        with which, under fire, Lieutenant Bonus adjusted the
        powder-bag to the gate, and enabled us to effect an
        entrance into the fort.&#146;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Fifty-seven enemy dead were later counted in the gateway of
the fort. The losses to the enemy was the death of the entire
garrison, the capture of one brass 9-pounder, and the destruction
of 150 matchlocks along with a variety of swords and spears.
British losses amounted to 4 officers wounded, 1 other rank
killed, and 22 wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonus was becoming quite familiar with the walls
and gates of the various forts of the plains of Central India,
with the fort of Loharri representing his third such encounter.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Battle Of Koonch, 7 May 1858 [14]</u></b></p>

<p>On the 5th of May 1858, Lieutenant Bonus was again on the
march with Sir Hugh Rose in the heat of India. Instead of
following the direct road to Koonch the march was inclined toward
the west in an attempt to turn Tantia Topi&#146;s entrenchment
and threaten his line of retreat. Tantia Topi had taken up
positions at Koonch after the battle of Betwa in an attempt to
block the advance on Calpee. Reconnaissance of Koonch had
determined that the town was open but it would be difficult to
attack because it was surrounded by woods and walled enclosures,
but as was their custom, the rebels who were 20,000 strong, had
chosen only to prepare to receive an attack by the direct road
from the south side of the town. There were only light
entrenchments to the west side. With the entrenchment enclosures
left with only minor garrisons, the job of the infantry and
Lieutenant Bonus with the engineers during the battle of Koonch
was an easy one and the rebels retired the city in short order
with an orderly retreat. This retreat was soon turned to chaos
when Sir Hugh ordered the cavalry and horse artillery to pursue
the retreating enemy. The enemy lost 500 to 600 men and 9 guns.
British loses were 9 killed and 47 wounded, but there were an
additional 45 fatal cases of sunstroke. The Sappers and Miners
remained behind the continuing advance for two days while they
destroyed a fort and other defenses around Koonch. Lieutenant
Bonus wrote his last letter from Koonch to his parents on the 10<sup>th</sup>
of May. By the 12<sup>th</sup> of May he was at Camp Lander and
on the 14<sup>th</sup> of May he wrote from Olera.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Action At Muttra, 16-17 May 1858 [15]</u></b></p>

<p>The heat of Central India continued to create problems for Sir
Hugh in his efforts to march for Calpee. He had to keep pressure
on the rebels and to accomplish this he was required to continue
marching his forces at an exhausting pace. Several days previous
to the action at Muttra the 2nd Brigade lost its way and in
consequence had to make a double march. Large numbers of the
Brigade suffered severely from the extreme heat, including
Brigadier Steuart and his whole staff. Lieutenant Colonel R. D.
Campbell, 71st Highland Light Infantry, then took command of the
Brigade and was supplemented with a detachment from the 1st
Brigade. Included with this detachment were Lieutenant Bonus and
some men of the Bombay Sappers and Miners. During his march of
the 15th of May Campbell&#146;s Brigade was harassed several
times at the rear by a force of the enemy about 5000 strong and
he was forced to stop several times and check their advance.
Lieutenant Bonus was mentioned in a despatch by the Commanding
Officer of the Rear Guard, Major Forbes, for his usefulness in
moving the baggage along and in conveying orders during these
actions [16]. Campbell then decided he should occupy the village
of Muttra to protect his left flank.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May the rebels, being reinforced from Calpee,
decided to attack Muttra with great determination but were driven
back by Campbell&#146;s Brigade. The attack was renewed on the
17th of May with the Brigade again driving back the enemy
attacks.</p>

<p>After these attacks Sir Hugh recognized the exposed position
of his left flank and this, combined with his dwindling water
supply at Deopura and Tehri, forced him to concentrate his forces
on a hillock and ridge west of Gallowlee. This position was the
only high ground between the British and the difficult network of
nullahs (severe gully washes) and ravines that surrounded their
approach to Calpee. The enemy had sworn on the sacred waters of
the Jumna River (on Sir Hugh&#146;s right during his marches
toward Calpee) to drive the British into the river or perish in
the attempt. On hearing this, Sir Hugh decided to play a short
waiting game and over the next few days he drove back minor
attacks from the enemy while minimizing the exposure of his
forces to the terrific heat [17] until he was in position for a
crushing blow to Calpee.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Battle Of Gallowlee, 22 May 1858 [18]</u></b></p>

<p>Sir Hugh&#146;s Central India Field Force now extended on a
line south and around toward the east of Calpee. This line
occupied the towns of Deopura, on the left, Tehri and Surauli, in
the center, and Gallowlee, on the right at the Jumna River. This
British position faced the net of ravines between the British
lines and Calpee. It was this line that the rebels under Tantia
Topi attacked in a general engagement on the 22nd of May.</p>

<p>In this engagement the Bombay Sappers and Miners functioned as
infantry defending and attacking with the changes in the battle
throughout the day. After the repulsing of the rebel attacks
along the entire line in some hard fighting, Sir Hugh ordered a
general advance of the British line toward Calpee to follow the
general defeat of the enemy. The Sappers worked day and night at
road making and hauling heavy guns across nullahs, ravines and
streams to get into position for the attack on Calpee.</p>

<p>In a letter to his parents, dated 22 May 1858, Lieutenant
Bonus has this to say about the action at Muttra while in camp
before Gallowlee:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;We, that is the Second Brigade, left Etowra
        at dawn on the 16</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i> and almost
        at once the enemy appeared on our flank. My company of
        Sappers formed part of the rear guard. I cannot imagine
        the reason for this. I think a mistake had been made as
        Sappers are not much use in such a position. Our rear
        guard was composed of all arms, Cavalry, Infantry,
        Sappers and Artillery (2 guns). It was not too strong for
        the enemy was in great force; they had 5 guns, about 1500
        Cavalry, and about a 1000 Infantry. If they had had the
        pluck to push their attack home they might have done us a
        great deal of damage. You see our business was not to
        fight an action but to protect the baggage and stores.
        The stores and supplies were nearly all in bullock carts.
        These move about 2½ miles an hour under ordinary
        conditions. In our case the conditions were by no means
        ordinary; the cattle were half starved, the loads heavy,
        the heat extreme, and the road a mere cross country track
        deep in dust. Very soon after our start we came to a
        nasty nullah which badly throttled the traffic. I took up
        my position here with my men in order to help the carts
        across; it was a wearisome job, a few carts broke down
        and had to be abandoned. We moved slowly across the
        plain, the enemy following us closely, and keeping a
        continuous fire from their guns, but their horsemen did
        nothing, they funked. Our guns of course were worked
        steadily. The affair was indeed a rather pretty sight. We
        lost several men. In the afternoon the General sent us
        some assistance and the enemy drew off. We halted at a
        village named Dipoora (?). It was a hot, tiring but
        exciting day. I do not want to be on rear-guard again. </i></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear from his description of the rear guard action of
the 15<sup>th</sup> of May, for which he received much praise
from Major Forbes, Lieutenant Bonus was not well inclined to
perform this type of duty. As a good officer and a good soldier
he did not complain to his superiors about the misuse of his
Sappers in this type of work. He followed his orders and did in
fact perform a commendable job. </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Capture Of Calpee, 23 May 1858 [19]</u></b></p>

<p>The engineers were so successful in moving the British
artillery into position that the vigorous shelling of Calpee
presented it as no attraction to the enemy as a place to retreat,
and so it was occupied on the 23rd of May 1858. Tantia Topi and
forces of the Rani of Jhansi now made for Gwalior. The Sappers
and Miners were completely exhausted from their strenuous work of
the past several weeks so that the several days rest they
received before Sir Hugh again ordered the advance to continue
toward Gwalior, on the 6th of June, was desperately needed.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Action At Morar Cantonments, 16 June
1858 [20]</u></b></p>

<p>After arduous marching, where the heat rose to 130 degrees in
the shade, Sir Hugh reached Behahdurpore five miles east of the
Morar Cantonments on the 16th of June. The troops had long been
on the road, and the sun was already high when a patrol of the
Hyderabad Cavalry reported that the rebels were at the Morar
Cantonments. True to his nature, Sir Hugh determined to attack
the rebel position at once. The Morar Cantonments were located on
the right bank of the Morar River and was traversed in center and
from east to west by the road to Gwalior. The enemy was holding
the cantonments with cavalry, the diversified broken and hilly
ground to the right and right front with infantry, and the belt
of nullahs to the front concealed strong bodies of infantry.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh&#146;s intentions were to mask the dangerous ground
on his left front and outflank the rebel left wing to attack the
cavalry position in the Morar Cantonment. Brigadier R. Napier was
in command of the 2nd Brigade, which formed the second line.
Lieutenant Bonus was serving as the Acting Assistant
Quarter-Master General of the 2nd Brigade. With the enemy
occupied by the first assault line, the 2nd Brigade directly
assaulted the enemy positions at the Morar Cantonment.
Reconnaissance had revealed that the positions in the nullahs to
the front and in the cantonment itself were strongly held by a
concealed enemy. These position were assaulted by the 2nd Brigade
in a well-executed attack. The Brigade was soon engaged in
difficult hand to hand fighting with a determined enemy, but with
cavalry assistance, very heavy losses were inflicted on the
enemy. After two long, hot hours of fighting the Morar
Cantonments were captured and the weary troops found welcome
shelter in the cantonment buildings that had not been destroyed.
The victory gave Sir Hugh Rose command of the road to Agra,
enabled communication with Dholpore on the right and
Kotah-ki-Serai on the left and opened an approach to Gwalior less
than four miles away.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bonus was again mentioned in despatches. Brigadier
R. Napier recommended to the notice of Sir Hugh, &quot;Lieutenant
Bonus, of the Engineers, Acting Assistant Quarter-Master general
of the 2nd Brigade, who rendered most zealous and efficient
assistance.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Battle Before And The Capture Of
Gwalior, 19-20 June 1858 [21]</u></b></p>

<p>After the defeat of the mutineers at the Morar Cantonments,
Sir Hugh attempted to apply pressure on the enemy retreating
toward Gwalior. With the reconnaissance information collected
early in the evening of the 18th of June, Sir Hugh realized that
the positions the enemy occupied in front of Gwalior showed that
their first intention was to preserve a defensive attitude. With
his usual grasp of the situation Sir Hugh at once attempted a
bold but safe move. He decided rather than wait for the enemy to
attack he would attack. The plan was to march around the enemy
flank and attempt to block the enemy&#146;s retreat into Gwalior.
This he ordered on the night of the 18th of June. The next
morning he ordered his infantry, including the Bombay Sappers and
Miners, to attack the enemy entrenchments and hillocks. These
attacks were a general success and the enemy went into full
retreat only to find themselves cut off from behind by the forces
of the flanking march. By sunset the town of Gwalior was in Sir
Hugh&#146;s hands; however, the fort was still occupied by the
rebels.</p>

<p>The next morning, the 20th of June, the officers and men of
the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, operating on their own
initiative, burst open the main gate of the fort and surprised
the guard of the other gates and the garrison. After a short,
sharp engagement they were able to take control of the fort from
a party of fanatical Mussulmen.</p>

<p>Enemy losses during the Gwalior operations between the 16th
and 20th of June 1858 were severe. British losses for the same
period were 29 killed and 65 wounded from combat operations.
There were additional British losses due to the severe heat with
some additional deaths resulting.</p>

<p>The action at Gwalior ended the operations in the Mutiny for
Lieutenant Joseph Bonus, Bombay Sappers and Miners. The value of
Sir Hugh Roses Central India Campaign can not be overstated. Much
has been written of the Lucknow and Delhi campaigns, but little
has been written of Sir Hugh&#146;s Central India Field Force
whose operations saved Southern India, included the destruction
of three rebel armies, and made possible the pacification of
India north of the Jumna. Sir Hugh must rank as one of the
greatest commanders of his day and it was young and imaginative
officers like Lieutenant Joseph Bonus who helped to make possible
such a claim.</p>

<p>General Prendergast makes some reveling observations that
serve to further illustrate this point. In the context of
remarking about the Commanding Field Engineer, Colonel Boileau,
there are some interesting insights including one on Lieutenant
Bonus:</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>&quot;Colonel Boileau was not remarkable for
        smartness or for military administrative qualifications,
        and he was not a dashing horseman, but his success as a
        military engineer was undoubted, and, considering the
        great ability he displayed in conducting the sieges of
        Dhar, Rhatghur, and Jhansi, it is remarkable that he was
        not nominated C.B. (Companion of the Bath) at the close
        of the campaign. On one occasion he compared the conduct
        of the Royal Engineers with that of the Indian Engineers,
        and said that on his going to the trenches we would be
        met by Captain (now General Sir Bevan) Edwards and the
        adjutant of the Royal Engineers, smartly dressed, with a
        salute and a &#145;Have you any orders, sir?&#146;
        whereas Lieutenant Bonus of the Indian Engineers, further
        on, almost in rags, would slouch up with a &#145;Hullo!'
        Boileau, what's up!&#146; The Royal Engineers had the
        advantage of a soldierly commandant and adjutant, and had
        not been in the field nearly so long as the Indian
        Engineers, and they happened to be a more showy lot than
        the others. The batteries thrown up by the Royal
        Engineers, in the same way were models of neatness, but
        the native sappers worked many more hours in the
        twenty-four, and their work was thoroughly practical,
        good enough for its purpose, but no time was wasted on
        extra finish.&quot; </i>[22]</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the end of hostilities in Central India, Lieutenant
Bonus wrote to his parents from Badawaz on the 3r<sup>d </sup>of
July 1858 to tell them that he was on his way to either Bombay or
Poona. He arrived at Goonah on the 5<sup>th</sup> of July and was
at Mhow by the 14<sup>th</sup> of the month.</p>

<p>For his services Lieutenant Joseph Bonus, Bombay Sappers and
Miners, was mentioned in despatches six times from January to
June of 1858 for actions that showed his gallantry,
resourcefulness, engineering skills, and administrative ability.
He was awarded the Indian Mutiny medal with the clasp Central
India and was promoted to Brevet Major.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Railway Engineering In Northern India
After The Indian Mutiny, 1858-1878 [23]</u></b></p>

<p>No trains were running in India in 1850. When Lieutenant Bonus
began working on the railroad in 1858 there were 427 miles of
open rail routes and by 1878 at the start of the 2nd Afghan War
there were 8,058 miles of open rail routes with another 1,387
miles under construction.</p>

<p>Joseph Bonus became involved in some of the greatest railroad
engineering that the world would ever see. The railroad was
important to opening, communicating with, serving, and supplying
long established trading areas throughout India. The mutiny had
also clearly demonstrated the importance of the railroad to the
military for supply and troop movement.</p>

<p>After the mutiny there was a period of transition as the
government of India took control of the railways and capital
expenditure for the expansion of the railways came under
centralized policy. On the 24th of March 1862 Bonus was
officially listed as a Deputy Consulting Engineer for Railways
with the Scinde Department of Public Works.</p>

<p>The country covered by the Scinde Railway (later the Indus
Valley Railway) is barren and hilly. It is not difficult country
through which to build a railway, but there were some unusual
climatic occurrences. The average rainfall varied between two and
a half and seven inches a year, but half the annual total might
fall in a single day. There is also a strong off sea wind that
blows across the country 330 days a year. The hills are between
150 and 200 feet high.</p>

<p>This type of country required no large earthworks in laying
out the rail. The gage was a wider gage, which became the Indian
standard, of 5 feet 6 inches. This gage gave the trains stability
to help them to stay on the tracks during the violent windstorms
experienced in the Scinde. The Scinde countryside provided
locally available limestone, which was used in the masonry works
required by the line. Due to the high rate of run off following
sudden storms the line required that 32 bridges be built.
Twenty-five of these were engineered as masonry arched bridges
with spans that varied between twenty and forty five feet. The
longest was a viaduct across the Bahrun River. It consisted of
thirty-two 45-foot long arches and was started on the 5th of
March 1859 and finished on the 26th of January 1861. The
engineering of all the arches, piers and abutments on the line
were designed to eventually handle a double line railway. The
line was 105¼ miles in length and ran from Karachi to Kotree
with intermediate stations at Landi, Dorbajee, Joongshaie and
Jeempeer. The line eventually was doubled in length throughout in
1897.</p>

<p>Joseph Bonus was promoted and worked on this railroad until he
moved to the Punjab Northern State Railway just before the start
of the 2nd Afghan War. As a Second Captain and Brevet Major,
Joseph Bonus was promoted to the position of Executive Engineer,
1st Grade on the 1st of September 1870. His position with the
railroad was Officiating Superintending Engineer of the Kotree
District of the Indus Valley Railway. He was promoted to Major on
the 5th of July 1872 and to Superintending Engineer, 3rd Grade on
the 14th of July 1873 at the Kotree District. He was promoted
again to Brevet Lieutenant Colonel on the 7th of February 1874
and then in 1877 to Superintending Engineer, 2nd Grade at the
Kotree District. He was promoted to the rank of substantive
Lieutenant Colonel on the 24th of August 1878.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The 2nd Afghan War, 1878-1880 [24]</u></b></p>

<p>At the outset of the 2nd Afghan War, Bonus was placed in
command of the Queens Own Sappers and Miners, served as a Field
Engineer, and took part in the Bazar Valley Expedition under
Lieutenant General Frederick Francis Maude, VC who commanded the
2nd Division of the Peshawar Valley Field Force. He was Mentioned
in Despatches and promoted to Brevet Colonel on the 7th of
February 1879 for his services, up to this point, in the 2nd
Afghan War [25].</p>

<p>The Afghan Medal Roll states that Colonel Joseph Bonus, with
the local rank of Brigadier General, was, &quot;engaged on survey
work from December 1879 to February 1880 between Jamrud and
Jalalabad and later between Thull and Peiwar Kotal.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1880, Colonel Bonus was again engaged in railroad
engineering work. He was promoted to Superintending Engineer, 1st
Grade, and was assigned to the post of Engineer-in-Chief on the
Punjab Northern State Railway in charge of the section being
constructed from Pindee Junction to Peshawar. When the Afghan War
broke out, work immediately began in late 1879 to push the Punjab
Northern State Railway from the Indus River to Peshawar. Colonel
Bonus was the Engineer-in-Chief of this project and this section
of the line was opened for traffic on the 1st of January 1881.</p>

<p>The 2nd Afghan War was the last time that Joseph Bonus served
on active field service. He was Mentioned in Despatches, awarded
a Brevet of Colonel, and received the 2nd Afghan War Medal with
no bar for his services.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>The Final Years Of Military Service [26]</u></b></p>

<p>After the 2nd Afghan War Colonel Bonus continued to serve
India&#146;s railways as the Joint Secretary for Railways and
Consulting Engineer to the Government of Bombay. Joseph Bonus was
involved as a engineer from the early days of the railroad
through to the beginning of realizing the dream of rail service
throughout all of India. In 1858 when he began his work began
there were 427 open miles of railroad and when he retired in 1886
there were 12,559 open miles of railroad. Major General Bonus
lived to see this number grow to more than double, to 26,317 of
open rail miles by the end of 1900. He was promoted to Major
General on the 25th of November 1886 and retired from the Army at
the end of the year with 31 years of service, all of it in India.</p>

<p align="center"><b>5. </b><b><u>POST MILITARY LIFE</u></b></p>

<p>After retirement General Bonus lived at Southfield House in
Frome, Somerset and later was Justice of the Peace for Middlesex.
He later moved to Newlands, Stanstead-Abbots, in Hertfordshire.
He was a member of the United Service Club. </p>

<p>Major General Joseph Bonus, Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners
and Royal Engineers died on Friday the 11th of June 1926 at
Newlands, Stanstead-Abbots, in his 90th year. At the time of his
death, he was one of a very few surviving Officers who were
trained at Addiscombe College for the military service in the
East India Company.</p>

<p align="center"><b>7. </b><b><u>MARRIAGE AND PERSONAL
INFORMATION</u></b></p>

<p>His first wife was Frances Mary Hart, the daughter of Mr.
William Hart, of the Indian Civil Service. Francis was born in
India in 1842. The 1881 British Census lists the Bonus family as
living at 8 Lansdown Place in Clifton, Gloucestershire. Joseph
Bonus is listed as a Lieutenant Colonel and Brevet Colonel, Royal
Engineers on the Active List. Besides his wife, two sons are
listed in the census return. Arthur R. Bonus, 14 years of age, is
listed as a Scholar and his place of birth is shown as India.
Arthur was born in 1867 while his father was employed with the
Scinde Department of Public Works. Ernest M. Bonus, age 11, also
is listed as a Scholar. His place of birth is given as Hastings,
Sussex. When Ernest was born in 1870, his father was serving as
an Executive Engineer in India with the Punjab Northern State
Railway. The Bonus family may have been home on leave when Ernest
was born or Mrs. Bonus may have gone home to have her baby while
her husband was on the Northwest Frontier of India. Bonus&#146;s
work in 1870 took him to the Khyber Pass to supervise railway
construction. In 1870, this was not the most hospitable of places
to bring a wife and to raise children. Mrs. Bonus may have opted
to return to England during this period for health and safety
reasons.</p>

<p>The Bonus&#146;s eldest son, William John, is not listed as
living with his parents in 1881. William John Bonus was born on
the 9<sup>th</sup> of July 1862 shortly after his father took up
his appointment with the Scinde Department of Public Works.
William was educated at Harrow (1876) and at the Royal Military
College at Sandhurst. At the time of the 1881 Census he was 19
years of age and probably away at school [27].</p>

<p>The 1881 Census indicates that the Bonus family had a staff of
three women working in their house at the time. The House and
Parlour Maid was a 27-year old woman from Butterleigh, Devonshire
by the name of Mary J. Hannabuss. Their cook was a 32-year old
woman from Celedge Brutle in Somerset by the name of Jane Watts
and the youngest house maid was a 19-year old by the name of Mary
J. Barrett from Tingewick in Buckinghamshire. </p>

<p>Joseph Bonus married a second time, perhaps as a result of the
death of his first wife. His second wife was Marion Sophia Stuart
Poole, who was the daughter of Mr. Richard Stuart Poole, of the
British Museum. Joseph Bonus also had a daughter. It is not known
if his daughter was issue from his first or his second marriage.</p>

<p>After graduating from Sandhurst, the Bonus eldest boy was
commissioned in the Dorsetshire Regiment in 1883. William John
Bonus performed regimental duties until 1895 when he was
appointed an A.D.C. In 1899 he was posted to serve as Deputy
Assistant Adjutant General for the Scottish District. He then
served as a Major with the Dorsetshire Regiment in Natal, South
Africa until the Relief of Ladysmith, after which he was
invalided and appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General of the
4<sup>th</sup> Division. He remained in South Africa until 1901
when he returned to England. For his service in South Africa he
was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was mentioned in
despatches while serving with his regiment. He was also awarded
the Queen&#146;s South Africa Medal with 5 clasps and the
King&#146;s South Africa Medal with 2 clasps. He went on to
become Colonel William John Bonus [28], D.S.O. and took command
of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, The Dorsetshire Regiment in 1906
just before the battalion embarked for India and remained with
the battalion until 1910 when he retired from the Army.</p>

<p>After retirement Colonel Bonus returned to active service in
the Great War as Acting Quarter Master General and served from
the 4<sup>th</sup> of August 1914 until July of 1916. He then
served in other capacities until 1919. Colonel Bonus was a member
of the Naval and Military Club.</p>

<p>William John Bonus died on the 21<sup>st</sup> of October 1943
after a brief illness. At the time of his death, he lived at
&quot;Sans Souci&quot; in Harrow-on-the-Hill in the Greater
London area. His remains were cremated and interred at Golders
Green [29].</p>

<p>The author has not yet contacted any living relatives of
General Bonus. A lady by the name of Miss A. Bonus was known to
have donated two of General Bonus&#146;s swords to the Royal
Engineers Museum at Chatham [30]. Miss Bonus may possibly be a
granddaughter of the General, but this is not known for certain. </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>ADDENDUM NO. 1</u></b></p>

<p>During the research into General Bonus&#146;s life it was
noted that he had never received any orders or decorations during
his service. This seemed strange for a man who had behaved
bravely on the field of battle on many occasions and who
ultimately rose to the rank of Major General. While researching
the award of the Distinguished Service Order to General
Bonus&#146;s son, it was noted that William John Bonus is listed
as the &quot;son of Major-General Joseph Bonus, K.P.&quot; The
post nominal indicates that General Bonus was appointed to The
Most Excellent Order of St. Patrick (K.P.). No verification of
him having this honour bestowed upon him has been found in any
other sources, including Who Was Who. The accuracy of the entry
in the D.S.O. book is questionable for a number of reasons as
listed below: </p>

<ol>
    <li>The original intent of the Order was for the peers of
        Ireland. Bonus did not seem to have any connection to
        Ireland and he certainly was not a peer.</li>
    <li>From 1833 the maximum number of knights at any one time
        was set at twenty-two. It would have been very unusual
        indeed for a non-Irish, non-peer to be appointed to this
        order when they were so few in number.</li>
    <li>No new non-royal knights were created by this Order since
        1922. A number of references dated before 1922 were
        consulted where General Bonus was listed. None of these
        references indicate that he was a K.P.</li>
</ol>

<p>Further research will be required to see if he was, in fact, a
Knight of the Order of St. Patrick, or if the entry in Creagh and
Humpris is simply an error. The simplest answer to this question
is probably that Bonus was a Magistrate for Middlesex and hence,
a Justice of the Peace (J.P.). Creagh and Humphris probably erred
in their book and meant to use the postnominal J.P. rather than
K.P. </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>ADDENDUM NO. 2</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Physical Description Of<br>
Major General Joseph Bonus</b></p>

<p>At the time that the research into General Bonus&#146;s life
was completed in May of 2002, no photograph of the man had been
found. There are, however, three sources from which information
can be drawn to provide some idea of his appearance. We know from
a description provided by Lieutenant Prendergast shortly after
the storming of Jhansi that Bonus was &quot;tall&quot; and
&quot;gaunt.&quot; It is probable that most of the men who took
part in the Central India campaign were thin due to strenuous
exertions, lack of food and the terrible climate; however, it is
probably safe to assume that Bonus was thin in build even under
ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>A contemporary engraving was made showing Lieutenant Bonus on
a scaling ladder against the wall at Jhansi during the escalade
attempt in 1858. The artist portrayed Bonus as tall and thin with
a receding hairline, a handlebar mustache, a straight nose and a
sharp jaw. Of course it is not possible to know how true to life
the engraving is, or whether the artist ever saw Bonus in real
life. </p>

<p>Fortunately, Creagh and Humphris published a photograph of
General Bonus&#146;s eldest son, William John, in their book on
the Distinguished Service Order. The photograph of William John
Bonus, probably taken near the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, shows that he had a long straight and rather thin nose,
a handlebar mustache and a strong chin. He is wearing a cap in
the photograph, so his hairline cannot be compared to that of his
father in the engraving. The photograph is a bust portrait of him
in &quot;mufti,&quot; thus his build cannot be determined.
However, he does appear to be of thin to medium build. If Joseph
Bonus&#146;s son bears any resemblance to his father, then we do
have some idea of what the General may have looked like. The
search for an actual photograph of Joseph Bonus is ongoing. </p>

testament on the 4<sup>th</sup> of July 1923 while he was living
at Newlands, Stanstead Abbotts in Hertfordshire. The will was
prepared by the firm of Stones, Morris and Stone Solicitors of 41
Moorgate, London E.C. 2. The signing of the will was witnessed by
R.C. Pharo Tomlin, Solicitor and Thomas J. Morant, Clerk. General
Bonus appointed his wife, Marion Sophia Bonus, and his son Ernest
Melvill Bonus, a Solicitor, of Capel House, New Broad Street,
London to be the executors of his will.</p>

<p>In his original will Bonus left his possessions in varying

<p><b><u>General List of Items Bequeathed to his Heirs</u></b></p>

<p>The possessions of a man say much about his interests,
education and the type of life that he led. The list of items
bequeathed to his heirs says much about the life of Major General
Bonus that was not readily apparent from a study of his military
service. For example, the possessions listed in his will show
that he and, perhaps other member of his family, were musicians
and that he had a favorite Italian violin. He appears to have
been a lover of art and an artist in his own right, with his
medium being watercolours. The General also appears to have
enjoyed woodworking and carpentry and was a hunter and shooter as
well as a fisherman. </p>

<p>The first Codicil to General Bonus&#146;s will was signed on 4
April 1924 and witnesses by R. C. Pharo, Solicitor and Francis G.
Pilker, Clerk, of the firm of Stones, Morris &amp; Stone. This
Codicil directed that a greater portion of his estate be left to
his daughter than had been specified in his original will. The
second Codicil to the will was prepared on 18 March 1926 and was
witnessed by the General&#146;s doctor, Robert Odell, M.D.,
F.R.C.S. of Bengeo, Hertford and Elizabeth Buchanan, Nurse, of 7
St. Andrews Mansions, West Kensington W.14. This Codicil
appointed his son, Arthur Rivers Bonus of the Oxford and
Cambridge Club, Pall Mall, London as an additional executor of
the will. Arthur Rivers Bonus was a retired Indian Civil Servant
at the time of his father&#146;s death in 1926. It may be assumed
that Mrs. Bonus, by then probably well advanced in years, was not
able to deal with the provisions of the will as well as her sons
and for that reason General Bonus also appointed his son Arthur
as an executor.</p>

<p>Major General Joseph Bonus died on the 11<sup>th</sup> of June
1926 at Newlands, Stanstead Abbots, Hertfordshire. He was 89
years old at the time of this death. His physician, Robert Odell,
M.D. certified the causes of death as 1) Senility and 2)
Myocardial degeneration. His son, Arthur Rivers was present at
his death. General Bonus&#146;s death was registered on 11 June
1926 in the Registration District of Ware, in the Sub-district of
Stanstead, in the County of Hertford by A.H. Wilshere, Registrar.</p>

<p><b><u>Probate of the Will</u></b></p>

<p>On the 28<sup>th</sup> of July 1926 probate of the will with
the two Codicils was granted to Ernest Melvill Bonus and Arthur
Rivers Bonus, two of the executors. The gross value of the Bonus
estate was almost £30,000.</p>

<p align="center"><b>COLONEL WILLIAM JOHN BONUS, D.S.O.<br>
The Dorsetshire Regiment</b></p>

<p>Since completing the research on his father, additional
detailed information has been uncovered regarding William John
Bonus. The following information has been taken from the work of
Creagh and Humphris (1924): </p>

<p><b>BONUS, WILLIAM JOHN, </b>Major, was born 9 July 1862, the
son of Major-General Joseph Bonus, K.P. He was educated at Harrow
and Sandhurst and was gazetted in the Dorsetshire Regiment as a
Lieutenant on 9 September 1882. He served in India and Egypt. He
became a Captain on 21 June 1890; was appointed Aide-De-Camp in
1890; Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (D.A.A.G.), Scottish
District, from 23 July 1895 to 23 November 1899, and was promoted
Major on 30 April 1899. He served in the South African War from
1899 to 1902 with the Dorsetshire Regiment in Natal until the
Relief of Ladysmith. He was present at the operations of 24
January 1900, and at the action at Spion Kop; operations of 5 to
7 February 1900, and at Vaal Kranz; operations at Tugela Heights
(14 to 27 February 1900), at action at Pieter&#146;s Hill. He was
D.A.A.G., 4<sup>th</sup> Division, 22 March 1900 to 11 December
1902 and took part in the operations in Natal (March to June
1900). He was present at the actions at Laing&#146;s Nek (6 to 9
June), and in operations in the Transvaal, east of Pretoria, from
July to 29 November 1900, including actions at Reit Vlei, Belfast
(26 and 27 August), Lydenberg (6 to 8 September) and Rhenoster
Kop. He was mentioned in Despatches [London Gazette, 8 February
1901], received the Queen&#146;s Medal and five clasps and the
King&#146;s Medal and two clasps. At the Battle of Spion Kop,
when acting as Brigade-Major, Major Bonus &quot;found it
necessary to go up and remain in the firing line. He took a party
round the Boer flank and enfiladed it, all the other members of
the party &#150; officers and men &#150; being killed.&quot; It
was especially for his services on this occasion that he was
created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order [London
Gazette, 19 April 1901 Citation: &quot;William John Bonus, Major,
Dorsetshire Regiment. In recognition of services during the
recent operations in South Africa.&quot;]. The insignia were
presented to him by the Duke of Cornwall and York, in South
Africa, on 14 August 1901. He was D.A.A.G., Belfast District, 29
January 1903 to 7 March 1904 and became a Lieutenant-Colonel 25
October 1900. He commanded the Dorsetshire Regiment from 1906 to
1910, was given the rank of Brevet of Colonel 25 October 1909,
and retired with the rank of Colonel on 16 December 1911. He
served as Acting Quarter Master General (A.Q.M.G.), Scottish
District, from 4 August 1914 to July 1916, and subsequently in
other capacities (he was Cable Censor from January 1917 until
Peace was proclaimed in 1919. </p>

<p align="center"><b>ADDENDUM NO. 5 </b></p>

<p>The following information was provided by Mr. Alan Pert, Music
Librarian, Seymour Centre, City Road, University of Sydney, NSW
2006, Australia in July of 2003:</p>

<p>Annie Bonus was a sister of Major General Joseph Bonus. Annie
called herself Anna and married her cousin Algernon Kingsford on
the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 1867. Algernon Kingsford studied
in Lichfield and later became a vicar of the Church of England at
Atcham, Shropshire. </p>

<p>Anna Kingsford was one of the first English women to qualify
as a doctor in the Medical School, Paris. She wrote poems, short
stories, a novel and mystical works. She was president of the
Theosophical Society in 1883 and in 1884 she formed her own
Hermetic Society. She died from tuberculosis on the 22<sup>nd</sup>
of February 1888 at the age of 41.</p>

<p>Edward Maitland wrote her biography in 1913 entitled <i>Anna
Kingsford, Her Life, Letters, Diary and Work.</i> Maitland states
that Annie was born at Maryland Point, Stratford, Essex on the 16<sup>th</sup>
of September 1846. According to Maitland, the Bonus family moved
to Blackheath when Annie was still quite young.</p>

<p>General Bonus also had a brother, Dr. John Bonus, who was a
vegetarian and who influenced Anna to become one as well. John
Bonus, born in 1828, was the general's eldest brother. He was the
author of a short book entitled <i>Thoughts in Verse for my
Friends</i>. John Bonus died in 1909. </p>

<p>The general had another brother whose given name was Schroder,
who became a clergyman in the Church of England. Apparently it is
this brother and his wife whose portraits are mentioned in the
general's will in Addendum No. 4.</p>

<p>Joseph Bonus's father John died in 1865 and his mother
Elizabeth Ann died in 1888.</p>

<p align="center"><b>ADDENDUM NO. 6</b></p>

<p>The personal library of Major General Joseph Bonus was listed
in his will as indicated in Addendum No. 4. A book from this
library was listed for sale on the Internet in July 2003 by
Xerxes Books of Glen Head, New York. The book is described by the
dealer as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Stael-Holstein, Baroness de. <i>TEN YEARS' EXILE OR
    MEMOIRS OF THAT INTERESTING PERIOD OF THE LIFE OF THE
    BARONESS DE STAEL-HOLSTEIN WRITTEN BY HERSELF DURING THE
    YEARS 1810, 1811, 1812 AND 1813.</i> London, 1821, Treuttel
    and Wurtz. Translated from French to English. Much on
    Napoleon. 8vo, 434 pp. Two bookplates (<b>Joseph Bonus</b>;
    Moore-Parera) and owner signed (<b>Elizabeth Ann Bonus</b>).
    3/4 leather. Good, front nearly detached, occasional light
    foxing, several page tips folded in by printer. $150.00.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The signature in the book indicates that it was owned by Major
General Bonus's mother, Elizabeth Ann. The general then inherited
the book from her and put his own bookplate in it. Another person
named Moore-Parera subsequently owned the book after General
Bonus. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In an email dated 14 January 2007, Nancy

<p class="MsoNormal"

General Bonus was an ancestor of my husband.&nbsp; Joseph had a
brother Charles William (1839-1883).&nbsp; Charles had several
children and his first born son William (1865-1891) came to
Canada.&nbsp; William died just days before his only child

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Nancy then
followed-up her email on 22 January 2007 with the following
information regarding the life and family of Joseph Bonus.</p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center"><b><u>An
Assortment of Notes on Major General Joseph Bonus</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">John and
Elizabeth Bonus moved from Maryland Point, Stratford, Essex to
Blackheath in April 1849.&nbsp; This may explain why Joseph was
baptized on the north side of the river Thames.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Joseph&#146;s
first wife Mary Francis Hart was born in India on February 6,
1842 and died July 30, 1886.&nbsp; Joseph and Mary Francis were
married on October 9, 1861.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Their sons were William John, Arthur Rivers
and Ernest Melvill.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mary Francis died July 30, 1886.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Joseph traveled
somewhat from the summer of 1890 through May 1891.&nbsp; Later in
his life, he must have had his diary or journal typed and bound.
My copy is entitled &#147;Round the World with Major-General J.
Bonus 1890-91&#148;.&nbsp; He started in Switzerland in the high
mountains with friends, &#147;doing a little climbing, some
sketching and generally having a good time.&#148; At the close of
the season, the party &#147;broke up.&#148;&nbsp; He, not wishing
to return to England, made his way to Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp;While in
Naples, a steamer came in and at an hour&#146;s notice, he
decided to travel to Alexandria and spend the winter in
Egypt.&nbsp; He then proceeded to Cairo and was asked to travel
up the Nile, a trip that took place from November 7 through
December 11.&nbsp; Back in Cairo, he spent some time with his
oldest son Willie<sup>i</sup> who was with his regiment there but
was leaving for England.&nbsp;&nbsp; From Cairo, he traveled to
Ceylon and then on to Calcutta.&nbsp; From Calcutta, he continued
to Rangoonreaching it on January 25, 1891.&nbsp; Leaving Rangoon,
he traveled to Kyanski to meet his son Arthur.&nbsp;
&#147;Arthur&#146;s permanent rank in the Commission is Assistant
Commissioner third grade, but he is acting as third grade Deputy
Commissioner.&nbsp; Traveling back to Rangoon, he continued to
Singaporearriving there on February 27.&nbsp; On March 8, he
reached Saigon.&nbsp; His next point was Hong Kong and on to
Japan until the 23<sup>rd</sup> of April.&nbsp; After 2 weeks
crossing the Pacific, he arrived in San Franciscoon May 7,
crossing by steamer to Oakland to meet the train for
Raymond.&nbsp; He left Raymond in what he writes &#147;a
char-a-banc with four horses.&#148;<sup>ii</sup>&nbsp; He says he
saw many waterfalls including the Bridal Veil, the Sentinel, the
Yosemite, the Royal Arch, the Vernal, the Nervada and the
Cascade.&nbsp; Returning to San Francisco, his record comes to an
end only to state that he traveled to Niagara Falls, New Yorkand
then crossed to Liverpool wanting to be back home in England for
the summer.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In the journal, he quotes &#147;I have
a vague resentment against India for having in some way caused
the illness which resulted in the ruin of my career.&#148;<sup>iii</sup></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;On November
14, 1891, Joseph married Marion Sophia Poole. &#147;Sophie&#148;
was born January 19, 1863 and was 28 years younger than her
husband.&nbsp; Joseph and Sophie had a daughter Audrey Sophia
Poole, who was born on August 4, 1894.&nbsp; She died in
Switzerland in 1962.&nbsp; I believe Audrey donated the swords to
the museum.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Joseph had only one grandchild.&nbsp;
Son Arthur (the Civil Servant in Kyanski) married Edith Spencer
and they had a daughter Kathleen Monier-Williams
(1895-1964).&nbsp; My information is from the notes Kathleen made
over her lifetime.&nbsp; She copied out wills, notes from other
family members, newspaper obituaries and the family bible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The people listed in Joseph&#146;s will
include nephew Henry Penn Bonus.&nbsp; It is actually Henry <b>Pem</b>
Bonus.<sup>iv</sup>&nbsp; I believe Mary Amelia Rivers was a
servant. (On the 1901 census, there was a Mary Amelia Revers
living with the family.&nbsp; She may have been with them for a
very long time.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The items listed in his will include the
&#147;water colour paintings by himself&#148;.&nbsp; Our families
are in possession of these many framed and unframed water colours
as well as some sketches.&nbsp; Joseph was extremely talented as
a painter.&nbsp; His water colours are exceptional and are a
history of the places he visited on his travels.&nbsp; The
portraits of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bonus refer to portraits of
Joseph&#146;s parents John Bonus &amp; Elizabeth Ann Schroder
Bonus.&nbsp; The portraits of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Schroder refer to
portraits of Elizabeth Ann&#146;s parents Joseph Schroder and
Sarah Moore Schroder.<sup>v</sup>&nbsp; The whereabouts of these
portraits is unknown.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Sophie was only 63 when her husband
Joseph died on June 11, 1926.&nbsp; However she had had a stroke
sometime after 1923.&nbsp; She recovered but was an
invalid.&nbsp; This is probably why Arthur was appointed as an
additional executor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophie died shortly after Joseph
on December 29, 1926.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Joseph&#146;s sister Annie, later
known as Anna Bonus Kingsford, married a cousin of her older
brother Henry&#146;s wife; that is, her sister-in-law&#146;s
cousin.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The Bonus Family were Merchant
Taylors.&nbsp; According to my notes Joseph was admitted to the
Freedom of the Company, by Patrimony, on July 6, 1904 or 1906.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;There were 12 children born to John
and Elizabeth Bonus.&nbsp; Joseph was number 7, the 5<sup>th</sup>
son.&nbsp; Our ancestor Charles William was number 9, the 7<sup>th</sup>
son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Footnotes to Addendum No. 7</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;i The
Monthly Army List for June 1890 shows William J. Bonus as a
Lieutenant in The Dorsetshire Regiment.&nbsp; He was probably
with the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the regiment, as the Army
List shows the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion in Egypt at that time.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">ii What he refers to as a
&#147;char-a-banc&#148; may have been a stagecoach.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText">iii This is a curious statement,
especially since he served for 31 years and retired as a Major
General.</p>

<p class="MsoFootnoteText">iv This is a correction to Addendum
No. 3 above. </p>

<p class="MsoEndnoteText">v This information clarifies the
