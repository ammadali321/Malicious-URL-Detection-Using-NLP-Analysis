They have repeatedly hired the same coach for football for 3 years while the football team has lost nearly every single game for 3 years. there athletics department is garbage the students want to participate the families want to participate while the coach continues to play favorites to certain players playing the same players repeatedly while continuing to lose. The coach for football needs to go coach pee wee football he needs more development and it should not be at the expense of high school players who are seeking scholarships for college. Half the team quits every year because he does not know how to use the players he has, he simply won’t play them . He has a camp every summer which he requires all players to attend all summer in order to be a starting player only for them to still be a losing team, however through no fault of their own. the district athletic director doesn’t care and clearly neither does the school. They don’t care and do not understand the impact that this has on students seeking scholarships for football. They are supposed to be there for the students all of them not just the ones they favor and it is evident that there is a great deal of bias taking place with this coach he doesn’t care about helping the entire team succeed and making the players better players he’s not there to help them grow into better players it’s just a job for him. He needs to step down.","has_comment":true,"topic_label":"Overall experience","topic_name":"Overall","answer":"3","answer_label":null,"answer_value":"3","date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589601,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589601/flag"}},"topical_reviews":[{"comment":null,"has_comment":false,"topic_label":"Learning","topic_name":"Learning","answer":"agree","answer_label":"In my experience, students at this school feel excited about what they're learning","answer_value":4,"date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589603,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589603/flag"}},{"comment":null,"has_comment":false,"topic_label":"Teaching","topic_name":"Teaching","answer":"neutral","answer_label":"In my experience, teachers at this school are respectful, supportive, and motivate their students to learn","answer_value":3,"date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589604,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589604/flag"}},{"comment":null,"has_comment":false,"topic_label":"Social-emotional support","topic_name":"Social Emotional Support","answer":"disagree","answer_label":"In my experience, this school supports students' mental health and emotional well-being","answer_value":2,"date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589605,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589605/flag"}},{"comment":null,"has_comment":false,"topic_label":"Safety","topic_name":"Safety","answer":"agree","answer_label":"In my experience, this school provides an environment safe from violence, discrimination, and harsh punishment","answer_value":4,"date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589606,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589606/flag"}},{"comment":null,"has_comment":false,"topic_label":"Family Engagement","topic_name":"Family Engagement","answer":"disagree","answer_label":"In my experience, the school welcomes and includes families as partners in their children's learning","answer_value":2,"date_published":"September 06, 2024","date_published_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","id":6589607,"school_id":1385,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/6589607/flag"}}],"would_recommend":"false","osp_viewed":0,"osp_response":null,"most_recent_date":"September 06, 2024","most_recent_date_raw":"2024-09-06T20:44:56-07:00","user_type_label":"Parent / Guardian","user_type":"parent","id":-425839987343131377}],[{"school_user_digest":"9hd8fuVQlAQOs0oZtyB+6A==","five_star_review":{"comment":"Some of the teachers act like they would rather be working a fast food job than working here.
