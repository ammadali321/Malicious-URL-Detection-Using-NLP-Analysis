  Delgado was left in charge of the fort. In March, a relief force
  was sent from San Diego to complete construction. News soon arrived
  at the Presidio of an impending native uprising. On April 26,
  the Kamia (or Kumeyaay) Indians of the San Sebastian area attacked
  Laguna Chapala.</FONT>

  During the late 1950s a group of archeologists and historians,

  with stone or adobe walls, mud ramps and ledges and crowned by
  a thorny ocotillo barricade, Measurements taken in 1958, however,
  revealed a structure about 100 feet Square.</FONT>

  Pacheco (2005)</FONT></B>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">by Justin Ruhge<BR>
<BR>
  Fort Romualdo Pacheco was built in an attempt by the Mexican
  government to reopen the de Anza trail between the Northern Mexico
  presidios and those in Alta California by way of the Yuma Crossing
  at the junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers. The original
  opening of this trail has been discussed in the foregoing sections
  under the de Anza Expedition and the founding of San Francisco.
  The events that closed this trail for forty years occurred on
  Tuesday, July 17, 1781. The Yuma Native Americans on the west
  side of the Colorado River revolted against the settlement of
  the Spanish at two new locations at Concepcion and San Pablo
  de Bicuner in December 1780 and January 1781 respectively. The
  new settlers insulted the Yumas and had much of their best river
  bottomlands confiscated by the new intruders. On this Tuesday,
  the Yumas attacked without warning and destroyed the new settlements
  and killed the priests and many of the villagers and soldiers.
  At this very time the expedition from Mexico of Fernando Rivera
  y Moncada, Lieutenant Governor of Baja California, was passing
  through the Yuma crossing on its way north to found the Presidio
  of Santa Barbara. The majority of the expedition cleared the
  area but Moncada and the cattle and some soldiers remained on
  the east side of the Colorado River. Moncada and his soldiers
  were killed in the ensuing battles. A party of soldiers from
  San Gabriel Mission who had arrived to aid Moncada in the original
  expedition was also killed. In order to verify the news of the
  Yuma massacre, two soldiers were dispatched from Altar, Mexico
  to the Colorado, and they were either killed or captured.<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Yuma casualties were to far exceed those
  of the Spaniards. The Spanish suffered a total of about 100 killed,
  approximately 60 men, 20 women and 20 children. The 60 men consisted
  of four friars, about 36 soldiers and 20 civilians. The Yumas
  held at least 74 persons captive. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">During September to December 1781, Pedro
  Fages led two expeditions from Sonora, which negotiated the release
  of all 72 known captives and recovered the bodies of the four
  friars. His troops extracted heavy losses from the Yumas who
  nevertheless remained unsubdued. Alta California Governor Felipe
  de Neve led another punitive expedition from September to October
  1782 from San Gabriel, which met Jossef Romeu's troops from Sonora
  at the Yuma Crossing. The Yumas were elusive but the Spanish
  managed to kill 108 Yumas, take 85 prisoners, and recover 1,048
  horses. The efforts during those two expeditions were punitive
  and did not reopen the Yuma Crossing or restore the two settlements.
<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Mexico won independence from Spain in
  1821. Emperor Agustin de Iturbide &quot;ruled&quot; from May
  19, 1822 to February 19, 1823. Emperor Iturbide was concerned
  over alleged foreign threats to California. He sent Agustin Fernandez
  de San Vicente to California in 1822. Fernandez reported that
  the Anza route should be reopened at once to protect the distant
  province. Father Felix Caballero of the San Miguel and Santa
  Catarina Missions in Baja California was sent by Fernandez to
  open a trail below the Yumas to Sonora. Leaving Santa Catarina
  on April 14, 1823 with two Native Americans, cattle and horses,
  they reached the Colorado quickly, near its mouth. With a Cocopah
  guide they circled south of the Yumas, followed the Gila, and
  arrived at Arizpe late in May 1823. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Governor Antonio Narbona of Sonora sent
  Captain Jose Romero and ten soldiers from Tucson to escort Caballero
  back to Baja California. They went north to the Gila, followed
  it west and cut across the Gila Range and the Tinajas Altas pass
  to the mouth of the Colorado. Cajuines where Quamaya Native Americans
  greeted them with a pretense of friendship and the roundtrip
  appeared to be a near success. With the river in flood during
  July, the Quamayas helped make rafts to carry equipment across.
  Then in midstream they tried to drown the Caballero-Romero party,
  stole their horses and drove them back to the east bank. Almost
  without clothing and poorly armed, the Spanish reached Santa
  Catarina on July 6, 1823. It appears that this was the first
  recorded trip from Sonora to California since the 1780s.<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Later in that year, Romero tried to get
  to Arizona from San Gabriel by a northern route but the party
  became confused in the Mojave Desert and straggled back to its
  starting point with little accomplished. Ten days later, Jalchedun
  Native Americans from Sonora, sent to locate Romero, reached
  San Gabriel after swiftly passing over the route he had sought
  without success. This was early in February 1824. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Almost accidentally, the central desert
  was crossed to the Yumas two months later. Santiago Arguello
  and twenty-four soldiers from San Diego pursued Native American
  horse thieves into the mountains, followed them through Warner's
  Pass, down the San Felipe Valley, through the Carrizo Corridor
  to the desert, and to the river only three days from San Diego.
  While they did not obtain their objectives of getting the horses
  or punishing the Native Americans, they had proven that the river
  could be reached from the coast with remarkable speed in April
  1824. Romero at San Gabriel tried twice to get permission to
  return to Sonora by land but was refused by the governor. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Meanwhile Jose Figueroa had succeeded
  Narbona as Governor of Sonora. Figueroa was intent on bringing
  the warring Pimas, Cocomaricopas, and Yumas together peaceably
  so the Sonora-California route might be reestablished permanently.
  When a meeting scheduled with the chiefs at Arizpe failed in
  1825, Figueroa decided to lead a force to the river and determine
  if the Yumas were peaceable. Further, he hoped to get Romero
  back to Sonora. From Tucson, October 26, 1825 the governor and
  400 soldiers approached the Yuma Crossing by way of the Gila.
  Cautiously sending scouts ahead to see if they would be received
  well, Figueroa finally reached the river on November 16, 1825.
  They camped across the Colorado from the ruins of Mission Concepcion.
<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Cargo Muchachos, the Yuma chief, appeared
  friendly and conferred with Figueroa. He accepted presents and
  told Figueroa that he would gladly assist in getting a message
  to Romero so they could meet at the Yuma Crossing. Still, Figueroa
  was wary. He sent Jose Cocomaricopa and twenty men to carry the
  word to Romero, intending to await his arrival before returning
  to Sonora. Instead he learned that the Yaqui Native Americans
  were rebelling and on November 19th had to return to care for
  that problem. A small force was left at Agua Caliente to greet
  Romero and word was sent to Governor Jose Maria de Echeandia
  of Alta California requesting 150 men to garrison the Colorado.
  Lastly, he sent another message to Romero so he would know the
  changes in plans.<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Romero received the news from Jose Cocomaricopa
  and Governor Echeandia assigned laborers to help open the trail.
  Lieutenant Romualdo Pacheco was to go with Romero and build a
  fort in San Gorgonio Pass. With the Arguello crossing of early
  1824 as an incentive, Romero and Pacheco argued that the southern
  route was preferable, that the Yumas seemed friendly, and that
  the fort might not be needed. Still, the expedition reduced to
  thirty-four men, poor and insufficient provisions, and with poor
  riding animals, left San Gabriel late in November. With Jose
  Cocomaricopa deserting in his impatience to get the party started,
  Romero used Julian Valdez as guide. They reached the Colorado
  somewhere near present day Blythe and Pacheco assisted the crossing.
  Romero finally reached Sonora, almost two and one half years
  since going west with Farther Caballero. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Pacheco and the rest headed southwest
  to the de Anza Trail and sent word ahead to Echeandia that they
  had not built the San Gorgonio Fort because the southern trail
  seemed more promising. At &quot;Laguna Chapala&quot; a shallow
  lake next to the New River channel, Pacheco and his soldiers
  and laborers built a structure and temporary fort to make that
  short Arguello route even safer. Pacheco reached San Diego after
  mid-February, 1826. Echeandia, under date of February 16th, reported
  to the Minister of War in Mexico on the new route to the river
  and the fort and shelter then being constructed. An escort of
  soldiers and laborers were to finish the work in March. After
  that time Echeandia planned to open a mail service via the new
  post in the desert to Sonora and hoped that his next orders concerning
  California might reach him over that route. Echeandia closed
  his report by commending the vigor and valor of Pacheco for opening
  a route through the Cahuillas, reporting in detail on the region,
  and putting up buildings to make the trail secure.<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Apparently Echeandia had sent a communiqu&eacute;
  dated January 29th to Figueroa in Arizpe, telling of Pacheco's
  progress in the desert. It must have been based on the word sent
  to Echeandia by Pacheco from the Laguna Chapala camp. From Arizpe
  on March 30th, Figueroa wrote to Echeandia that they would have
  to reward the Native Americans and take their chances with them
  until the Mexico City government decided how to handle the situation
  on a permanent basis. Figueroa was not too sure of Yuma friendship.
<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">It was not from the Yumas, however, that
  trouble came. At Santa Ysabel, west of Warner's Pass, Juan Maria
  Ibarra wrote to Echeandia of an attack by more than 100 San Felipe
  Valley Native Americans on the Santa Ysabel outpost in the morning
  of April 5, 1826. Ibarra and some Native American allies pursued
  the attackers into the San Felipe Valley, killing twenty-eight
  of them. Ibarra apologized for only sending twenty pairs of ears
  from the Native Americans since his men were very tired from
  the half day battle. An attacker was taken prisoner, held at
  Santa Ysabel for a couple of weeks, and then executed on April
  23rd. The war continued to the next day, with San Felipe Native
  Americans loyal to Mexico killing eighteen of the &quot;Jaqui&quot;
  and keeping the thirty-six ears for celebration. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">On April 26th Native Americans from the
  San Sebastian area, part of the wide-spreading Kumeyaay peoples
  of present day San Diego County, assaulted Fort Pacheco. This
  battle brought death to three defenders and three others were
  wounded. With no assurance that the disorders would end soon,
  the fort was abandoned and its small garrison was removed to
  San Diego. Pressed between the unpredictable Yumas and the intermittent
  hostility of the Native Americans to the west, there is no record
  that Fort Pacheco was reactivated after April 1826. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Romualdo Pacheco was a native of Guanajuato,
  Mexico. He arrived in Alta California in 1825 as an aide to Governor
  Echeandia whom he accompanied on the trip north. He became Comandante
  of the Monterey and Santa Barbara Presidios. Pacheco was killed
  at the Battle of Cahuenga on December 4, 1831. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1826, the first American trappers came
  into California. Jedediah Smith, the pioneer, came through Mojave
  country to the north of the de Anza area. The Pattie party got
  to Santa Catarina Mission in Baja California the next year, and
  then to San Diego. Ewing Young came to the Colorado in 1826,
  reached the Yuma Crossing late that year or early in 1827, and
  was the first American to meet the Yumas. They were still friendly,
  in the same year that Figueroa was having his doubts about them.
  On this same visit to the Colorado, the party with Young traversed
  the entire length of the Grand Canyon before returning to Santa
  Fe. Again, they were the American pioneers. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Ewing Young again set out from Santa Fe
  and Taos late in the summer of 1829. Kit Carson was with this
  expedition. They crossed the Colorado into Mojave country and
  got to San Gabriel Mission in 1830. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">These and other &quot;Mountain Men&quot;
  expeditions did not often cross the Imperial Valley. Their fortunes
  and misfortunes with the various Native American groups varied
  from one time to another. However, they did show that getting
  into California from New Mexico, Arizona, and <BR>
<BR>
  Sonora was increasingly common after the war of 1826, which closed
  Fort Pacheco. Perhaps it was a lack of interest in the land route,
  as increasing sea contacts were made in the next decades, which
  led Mexico and California to ignore it for the rest of the Mexican
  regime. On the other hand, the American interest in the overland
  routes increased almost steadily in the 1830s and 1840s well
  before the war of 1846 to 1848 with Mexico. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">During the Mexican-American War several
  American parties came to the Yuma area, most still finding the
  Yumas peaceable. The major expeditions of Stephen Watts Kearny,
  Philip St. George Cooke, and Lawrence P. Graham all went by way
  of the Yuma Crossing and across the desert on variations of the
  de Anza route into the Carrizo Corridor and up the San Felipe
  Valley. By the end of the war this southern route was rather
  well established, especially due to the work of the Cooke expedition.
  But the increasing American migration upset the Yumas and late
  in the 1840s they became unpredictable again. The gold rush of
  1849 which led Cave Couts to set up &quot;Camp Salvation&quot;
  at Calexico to aid desert crossers, added to the Yuma unrest.
  Late in November 1850, Major Samuel Heintzelman and sixty troopers
  came to the Yuma Crossing, set up Camp Yuma at the site of the
  1780 Fort Concepcion, and within two years got the Yumas to end
  their hostilities. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">If any of the increasing number of travelers
  after 1826 saw Fort Pacheco on the New River Channel and wrote
  about it, nothing has been reported. With the growth of the southern
  California population in the 1880s and the increasing number
  of visits to the deserts no one reported stumbling onto the fort.
  But in 1891, two prospectors were forced to seek high ground
  during a flood of the New River. On June 24th, they were surprised
  to find a rude fort. This was twenty-five miles north and east
  of Indian Wells. The fort, which had been long abandoned, was
  300 feet square, its walls six feet high, and inside of it were
  ruins of a house and the charred remains of some heavy wagons.
  Nearby was a pool of water fed by a spring in which were fish.
  The prospectors, W.W. Webb and L. N. Gridley, escaped the flood
  and reached San Diego early in July. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">The Imperial Press on May 4, 1901 reported
  on the Fort and speculated that it had been used by U. S. soldiers
  to protect the mails carried across the desert by stages in the
  1850s and 1860s. A year later the same paper commented on a new
  find near the old Fort. S. D. Yokem found a charred mesquite
  post and human bones and teeth just below the surface of the
  soil, 300 feet north of the old Fort and six miles west of Imperial.
  Dr. J. W. Oakley found what he thought was a white glass crucifix,
  melted by fire near the post. After speculating that maybe a
  Catholic priest had been burned at the stake, the Imperial Press
  noted other artifacts found nearby. These included a piece of
  a razor, a large knife, perhaps a file, part of a wagon axletree,
  and a copper utensil. The article also commented on the location
  of the Fort, in a crescent formed by a curve in the New River,
  where water could be obtained at any time from a shallow well.
<BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Other scattered bits of information indicate
  that the Fort was an object of much conjecture among early Imperial
  Valley settlers. They varied as to the dimensions and presence
  of structures in the interior but most stated that it had an
  opening to the east, some gun emplacements at the corners, and
  ramps to the gun posts. The walls were about six feet high and
  a moat or ditch surrounded the structure.</FONT>

  then about waist high and two to three feet thick. Then a grader
  leveled the site so it could be used for agricultural purposes
  and the remains of the Fort were pushed into the New River. <BR>
  </FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">The Imperial Valley College Museum began
  excavating on the site in February 1978 under archaeologist Jay
  von Werlhof. They found remains of the ditch. In March 1979 excavators
  from the museum located the rest of the ditch and were able to
  establish that the fort was about 140 feet square. Though the
  remains had been destroyed, the archaeologists concluded that
  the site was the Pacheco Fort of 1825 to 1826, the only Mexican
  fort built in Alta California. <BR>
