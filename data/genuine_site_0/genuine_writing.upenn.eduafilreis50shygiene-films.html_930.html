               Sarah Inman stares out her kitchen window. Her hands
mechanically
               dunk a plate into a sink of soapy water. "Those, those
          apple-polishers," she says, scornful of her classmates. 
<p>
          "I don't like them!" 
<p>
          "Punkin!" her father snaps, grabbing a dish towel. "All these
people you
          don't like, aren't they happier than you?" 
<p>
          The camera locks on Sarah's eyes filling with tears as Dad's
last words
          echo on the soundtrack: "Aren't they happier than you . . .
happier than
          you . . . "

          This domestic vignette is from
          "The Snob" (1958), one of
          more than 70 classroom films
          to be presented at a series I
          curated called "Mental
          Hygiene: Social Guidance
          Films 1945-70" at the
          American Museum of the
          Moving Image in Astoria,
          Queens, beginning Saturday
          and continuing through Jan.
          23. It is the largest
          retrospective of such films,
          and the first public screening
          of many of them in more than
          30 years.

<p>
          Anyone believing that the 1950's was a time of innocent fun, or
that
          social coercion is a tactic exercised only in despotic, faraway
lands, will
          be disabused of the notion after viewing (or re-viewing) some of
these
          movies. Guidance as well as scare films, they cover a broad
swath of
          everyday social behavior, from mealtime deportment ("Lunchroom
          Manners") to drug use ("The Terrible Truth") to teenagers'
reckless
          driving habits ("The Last Prom"). 
<p>
          Generally less than 15 minutes long, these short films serve as
both a
          lesson in the pathology of the American psyche and a deliciously
dark
          form of entertainment. This is not a retrospective for the
irony-impaired. 
<p>
          Over four decades, millions of public school children saw these
films,
          which had the blessings of contemporary social scientists. The
movies
          thrived in the climate of confusion and nervousness in America
between
          World War II and Watergate, when moral codes and social norms
were
          being increasingly challenged and disobeyed. To cope with this
tempest,
          parents and educators embraced the mental hygiene film.
Ham-fisted,
          dogmatic, frequently brutal, these films preached the joys of
domesticity
          and uniformity. 
<p>
          A popular assumption is that mental hygiene films are cinematic
junk. But
          they vary in style and quality, depending on the studio (Coronet
and
          Centron were two) or the director, Sid Davis and Emily Benton
Frith
          among them. Flashes of dramatic technique often pierce the
low-budget
          fog: the film noir of "Right or Wrong?" (1951); the frantic
cross-cutting
          and melodramatic zoom of "Last Date" (1950); the dizzying
hand-held
          camera work in "Narcotics: Pit of Despair" (1967). 
<p>
          Of course, mental hygiene films rarely met traditional standards
of film as
          entertainment or art, nor did they aspire to. Rather, they took
their cues
          from the training and propaganda films of World War II, and thus
sought
          to portray everyday life as realistically -- that is, as
mundanely -- as
          possible. A classroom audience was not supposed to watch a
mental
          hygiene film and be enthralled by its direction, cinematography,
acting or
          editing. The students were supposed to believe that what they
saw was
          real and to adopt the film's point of view. 
<p>
          The creators of these films were, for the most part, anonymous,
valued
          more for their ability to grind out product than for their
filmmaking
          artistry. Crews were spartan, sets were cobbled together,
equipment was
          minimal and actors were often just young people from the
neighborhood. 
<p>
          Education theory held that young people were social mimics who
would
          imitate whatever behavior they saw acted out onscreen; hence the
          protagonists in these films were usually well-mannered, polite
-- and
          one-dimensional. 
<p>
          The approach may have calmed the fears of mid-20th-century
educators,
          but it plays havoc with our notions today of what life was
really like in,
          say, 1952. "Are You Popular?" (1958) and "Friendship Begins at
Home"
          (1949) present a vision of an innocent, idyllic past, but it
bears
          remembering that there would have been no need for mental
hygiene films
          if the young really had behaved so pleasantly. Productions like
"Mind
          Your Manners!" (1953) and "What Makes a Good Party?" (1950)
          depict life not as it was but as the films' adult creators
wanted it to be. 
<p>
          Ultimately, of course, students charted their own courses
heedless of the
          beacons offered by these films. And their disobedience spawned
more
          mental hygiene films, intended to scare the rebellious. These
films are the
          focus of several programs in the Astoria series: "The Dark
Side," about
          the consequences of bad behavior (Jan. 9), "Highway Safety"
(Jan. 15),
          "Drugs" (Jan. 22) and "Troublemakers" (Jan. 23). 
<p>
          The dark themes were the mainstays of independent filmmakers
like Sid
          Davis and Dick Wayman. Mr. Davis, a Hollywood stand-in who
yearned
          to direct, found his niche making films about topics no one else
would
          touch: date rape ("Name Unknown"), substance abuse ("Keep Off
the
          Grass"), childhood death and injury ("Live and Learn"). 
<p>
          He prided himself on being able to make a film, from idea to
master print,
          for only $1,000; such low budgets necessitated flat visuals,
which Mr.
          Davis overlaid with often bombastic narration to convey the
drama that
          the images could not. Nevertheless, Mr. Davis's films
occasionally
          display flashes of visual dynamism and artistry not found
elsewhere in this
          genre: a traveling shot of teenagers barreling down a California
freeway in
          "Seduction of the Innocent" (1961) as they pop pills and swill
7Up; a
          lovingly composed shot of a police investigator, a receding
ambulance
          and an overturned car at the end of "What Made Sammy Speed?"
          (1957). 
<p>
          There are no concessions to art in the films of Dick Wayman,
whose
          "Wheels of Tragedy" (1963) will be shown on Jan. 15. Wayman, an
          executive with the accounting firm Ernst & Young, used a
portable
          16-millimeter movie camera to record the bloody aftermaths of
fatal
          highway accidents, then spliced them together into loosely
constructed
          safety films intended to shock. It was a triumph of "reality"
over the
          carefully made fiction of studio films, an approach that gained
favor with
          educators as the 1960's themselves grew more violent and
          confrontational. 
<p>
          Thousands of mental hygiene films were produced, yet only a
handful
          survive. Schools showed them over and over until they were worn
and
          shredded. 
<p>
          Prints that escaped destruction were tossed into the trash when
they
          became out of date or when school audiovisual departments
shifted to
          video. When mental hygiene production companies went out of
business
          -- as they all eventually did -- their master prints were thrown
away,
          along with almost all information about the films' creators,
casts and
          costs. Preservationists showed little interest in saving what
remained. At
          least half of all mental hygiene titles have vanished, and many
survive
          today as only a single, battered print. 
<p>
          Mental hygiene films conveyed the opinions of their creators.
Some
          would call this propaganda, others guidance. To Ted Peshak,
however,
          who directed hundreds of these movies for Coronet, "mental
hygiene
          films boiled down to a compromise between real life and life as
it ought
          to be."
