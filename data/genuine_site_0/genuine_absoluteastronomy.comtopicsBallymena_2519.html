<br />
Two miles north of Ballymena in the townland of Kirkinriola, the ancient parish church and graveyard possess several indicators of Early Christian settlement including a souterrain. Also in 1868, a gravedigger found a large stone slab on which was carved a cross with the inscription <i>ord do degen</i>. This refers to Bishop Degen, who lived in Ireland during the 7th century. This stone is now in the porch of the Parish Church of St Patrick, in the Parish of Kilconriola, which is found in Castle Street, Ballymena.<br />
<br />
At the end of the 5th century, a church was founded in Connor, 5&nbsp;miles south of Ballymena. This was followed by a monastery at Templemoyle, Kells.

In the 1950s Saint Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena was the Regimental Training Depot of the Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th). Many young men who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, embarked upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many of these young men were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th)merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers.<br />

Ballymena is about 10 Km from Slemish Mountain the legendary first known Irish home of Saint Patrick.  The mountain rises about 1500 feet (437 metres) above the surrounding plain, and it is actually the central core of an extinct volcano. According to legend, following his capture and being brought as a slave to Ireland, Patrick worked as a shepherd at Slemish Mountain for about six years, from ages 16 through 22, for a man named Milchu (or Miluic).<br />
<br />
It was during this time that Patrick turned to frequent prayer as his only consolation in his loneliness.  In a vision he was encouraged to escape and return home. He did, became a priest and returned to Ireland, allegedly to convert his old master. The legend goes that his own real conversion took place while on Slemish out in all weathers, communing with nature and praying continuously. As Patrick was not the first Christian Bishop to visit Ireland, his ministry was confined to the North.  Here he established churches and an episcopal system. One such church is thought to have been founded at the nearby site of Skerry Churchyard.<br />
<br />
Slemish Mountain is open year-round, and on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March) large crowds hike to the top of the mountain as a pilgrimage. The one and a half kilometre round walk to the summit and back takes approximately one hour in good weather. Excellent views can be had of the Antrim and Scottish coasts to the east.  Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains are all normally visible to the west whilst the Bann Valley and the higher summits of the Antrim Hills can be seen to the North.  The 180 metre climb is steep and rocky.  The path can become very slippery in wet weather so care should be taken.<br />
