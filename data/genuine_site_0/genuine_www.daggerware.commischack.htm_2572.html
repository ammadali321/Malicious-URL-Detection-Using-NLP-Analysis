<H2>Some extra files for <A HREF="hackmstr.htm">HackMaster</A></H2>
The nice thing about the <A HREF="hackmstr.htm">HackMaster</A> system is that the trap patch installation routines are only present in <A HREF="hackmstr.htm">HackMaster</A> itself, leaving the Hack files to be lean and mean.<P>
This page is devoted to tiny little Hack files that do very specific things but aren't worth your money to register.  All are freeware, so share and enjoy.<P>
<A NAME="MenuHack"><H3>MenuHack v1.2</H3>
MenuHack corrects a small user interface deficiency in the PalmPilot.  Ordinarily, clicking in the title bar of an application does nothing, which is very counter-intuitive for anyone used to the drop-down menus of Macs and PCs.<P>
Thus MenuHack fixes things so that clicking in the title bar of an application (if the app has a title bar, of course) will drop down the menu bar, thus saving yourself on the order of half a second that you would ordinarily have taken to move the stylus down to the silk-screened area.<P>
The v1.2 update is now fully compatible with the new PalmPilot models.  Owners of previous Pilot models should also get the update, though, since 1.2 also includes a minor compatibility fix for a few third-party apps.<P>
I'm sure you just wanna download it at this point.  Here it is:<BR>
