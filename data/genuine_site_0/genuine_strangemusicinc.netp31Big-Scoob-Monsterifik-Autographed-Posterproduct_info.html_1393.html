<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Packages are generally processed and shipped within 2 business days after receipt of payment. Packages are shipped via USPS or FedEx and include a tracking number.</p>
<p><b>****** Please note: *******</b> During a sale processing time on orders is longer.</p>
<p>All packages over $100 will require a signature.  Some other packages will also require a signature.</p>
<p>Shipping fees include handling and packing fees as well as postage costs. Handling fees are fixed, whereas postage fees vary according to total weight of the shipment. We advise you to group your items in one order. We cannot group two distinct orders placed separately, and shipping fees will apply to each of them. Some orders cannot be shipped in the same package. The orders will automatically be split into 2 orders. Boxes are amply sized for your items to be well-protected.</p>
<p>All orders are subject to product availability. If an item is not in stock at the time you place your order, we will notify you and refund you the total amount of your order, using the original method of payment.</p>
<h2>Delivery Location</h2>
<p>Items offered on our website are NOT available for delivery to addresses in countries where there is a high percentage of fraudulent credit card orders.</p>
<h2>Delivery Time</h2>
<p>Delivery times are estimates and commence from the date of shipping, rather than the date of order. Delivery times are to be used as a guide only and are subject to the acceptance and approval of your order.</p>
<h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
<p>Shipping costs are based on the weight of your order and the delivery method. To find out how much your order will cost, simple add the items you would like to purchase to your cart, and proceed to the checkout page. Once at the checkout screen, shipping charges will be displayed.</p>
<h2>Damaged Items in Transport</h2>
<p>If there is any damage to the packaging on delivery, <a class="contact-link" href="/index.php?controller=contact">contact us.</a> immediately.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about the delivery and shipment or your order, please <a class="contact-link" href="/index.php?controller=contact">contact us.</a></p>
