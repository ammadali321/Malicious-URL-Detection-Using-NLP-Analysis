I cannot even pretend to know all about the NAIA’s top programs, so I decided utilize my own mathematical musings to come to some conclusions based on the numbers. Now, I know that the NAIA isn’t exactly a hotbed that our traditional Swish Appeal readers follow on the regular, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t start paying attention to teams in your area now.\nSimilar to the football BCS that everyone loves to hate, the final order was determined by three distinct parts, and two of which are human-based. I also went back five years (like James did) and factored in the average of the last five final season coaches polls for 1/3 of the tally. The other 1/3 with human involvement is the last five tournament results, with teams getting points based on how far they advanced in the NAIA Division I Championships.\nThe third and final piece of the overall score was this season’s preseason Massey Ratings, released this week. If you don’t already know, in football the Massey Ratings are one of the computer programs used in the BCS system. Massey takes numerous factors into account and uses complex statistical formulas to reach his final order.\nThe factors that go into the Massey rating system for basketball are:\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power - estimated strength of the team\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offense\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-court advantage\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength of schedule\n&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As the season progresses, expected wins and losses are also factored in)\nOne thing to note about the NAIA is it’s in constant flux, with teams entering from NAIA Division II or exiting to move up to NCAA Division II. It appears Massey only took into account schools that are not in the exit process, so you’ll see names like Azusa Pacific (Calif.) and Union (Tenn.) off the list despite their virtual dominance in the recent past, including a 1-2 in the 2012 preseason poll. Other schools like Point Loma Nazarene (Calif.), Southern Nazarene (Okla.), Shorter (Ga.) and Trevecca Nazarene (Tenn.) surely would have appeared in the Top 50 as well, had they not been in the transition to the ranks of the NCAA.\nTo compile the list, I started with Massey’s ratings. As for how accurate the computer is when it comes to NAIA women’s basketball, I have not the foggiest clue. So if you see a team left off the list that should be there, the Massey Ratings are the first place I’d look to try to decipher why the team is omitted.\nI went ahead and drew the list out to the Top 50, however the numbers indicate many in the bottom 1/3 could be reasonably moved up or down, or replaced by other worthy programs. Particularly with the lower portion of the list, I have not much (or sometimes not at all) knowledge at all of the programs. But the numbers put them there, and who doesn’t like to see their names on a fun list? I’ve added comments on some teams based on facts gleaned from the 2011 NAIA tournament press book or first-hand knowledge.\nThe first number you’ll see listed on each school is the program’s overall score by my maths, followed by Massey’s 2011 computerized preseason rating. If the team is ranked in the current preseason Top 25, that will be listed third. The numbers are there so perhaps you can gauge the distance between programs. Or you might use the numbers to see how their recent history program number correlates to their 2012 projections. Other than that, the numbers are probably there so you can see that, yes indeed, I used numbers to compile the list (despite my homerism for #2, OCU).\nFor context and reference there are 271 NAIA member institutions (including those in transition elsewhere) and 112 of these schools participate in NAIA Division I women’s basketball and are listed on the 2011-12 posteason qualification plan. So without further ado:\n1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanguard (Calif.)\nOverall program score - 7.8; 2011 preseason Massey Rating - 7th; 2012 Preseason Poll - 10th\nThe Lions have not missed a postseason tournament since 2001.

to do the same with the Top 50 programs in NAIA Division I recent history. I cannot even pretend to know all about the NAIA’s top programs, so I decided utilize my own mathematical musings to come to some conclusions based on the numbers. Now, I know that the NAIA isn’t exactly a hotbed that our traditional Swish Appeal readers follow on the regular, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t start paying attention to teams in your area now.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">Similar to the football BCS that everyone loves <strike>to hate</strike>, the final order was determined by three distinct parts, and two of which are human-based. I also went back five years (like James did) and factored in the average of the last five final season coaches polls for 1/3 of the tally. The other 1/3 with human involvement is the last five tournament results, with teams getting points based on how far they advanced in the NAIA Division I Championships.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">The third and final piece of the overall score was this season’s preseason<a href="http://www.masseyratings.com/index.htm"> Massey Ratings</a>, released this week.

It appears Massey only took into account schools that are not in the exit process, so you’ll see names like Azusa Pacific (Calif.) and Union (Tenn.) off the list despite their virtual dominance in the recent past, including a 1-2 in the<a href="http://naia.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/102411aad.html"> 2012 preseason poll</a>. Other schools like Point Loma Nazarene (Calif.), Southern Nazarene (Okla.), Shorter (Ga.) and Trevecca Nazarene (Tenn.) surely would have appeared in the Top 50 as well, had they not been in the transition to the ranks of the NCAA.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">To compile the list, I started with Massey’s ratings. As for how accurate the computer is when it comes to NAIA women’s basketball, I have not the foggiest clue. So if you see a team left off the list that should be there, the Massey Ratings are the first place I’d look to try to decipher why the team is omitted.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">I went ahead and drew the list out to the Top 50, however the numbers indicate many in the bottom 1/3 could be reasonably moved up or down, or replaced by other worthy programs. Particularly with the lower portion of the list, I have not much (or sometimes not at all) knowledge at all of the programs. But the numbers put them there, and who doesn’t like to see their names on a fun list? I’ve added comments on some teams based on facts gleaned from the<a href="http://naia.cstv.com/photos/schools/naia/sports/w-baskbl/auto_pdf/DIWBB_2011_PressBook.pdf"> 2011 NAIA tournament press book</a> or first-hand knowledge.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">The first number you’ll see listed on each school is the program’s overall score by my maths, followed by Massey’s 2011 computerized preseason rating. If the team is ranked in the current preseason Top 25, that will be listed third. The numbers are there so perhaps you can gauge the distance between programs. Or you might use the numbers to see how their recent history program number correlates to their 2012 projections. Other than that, the numbers are probably there so you can see that, yes indeed, I used numbers to compile the list (despite my homerism for #2, OCU).</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1nfb3k4i _16w9vov1 _16w9vov0 ls9zuh1">For context and reference there are 271 NAIA member institutions (including those in transition elsewhere) and 112 of these schools participate in NAIA Division I women’s basketball and are listed on the<a href="http://graphics.fansonly.com/schools/naia/member-services/championships/Qualifcation_Plans/qual_plans_pdf/qual_WBB_DI.pdf"> 2011-12 posteason qualification plan</a>.

I cannot even pretend to know all about the NAIA’s top programs, so I decided utilize my own mathematical musings to come to some conclusions based on the numbers. Now, I know that the NAIA isn’t exactly a hotbed that our traditional Swish Appeal readers follow on the regular, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t start paying attention to teams in your area now.\nSimilar to the football BCS that everyone loves to hate, the final order was determined by three distinct parts, and two of which are human-based. I also went back five years (like James did) and factored in the average of the last five final season coaches polls for 1/3 of the tally. The other 1/3 with human involvement is the last five tournament results, with teams getting points based on how far they advanced in the NAIA Division I Championships.\nThe third and final piece of the overall score was this season’s preseason Massey Ratings, released this week. If you don’t already know, in football the Massey Ratings are one of the computer programs used in the BCS system. Massey takes numerous factors into account and uses complex statistical formulas to reach his final order.\nThe factors that go into the Massey rating system for basketball are:\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Power - estimated strength of the team\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Offense\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Defense\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Home-court advantage\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Strength of schedule\n\u0026middot; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;(As the season progresses, expected wins and losses are also factored in)\nOne thing to note about the NAIA is it’s in constant flux, with teams entering from NAIA Division II or exiting to move up to NCAA Division II. It appears Massey only took into account schools that are not in the exit process, so you’ll see names like Azusa Pacific (Calif.) and Union (Tenn.) off the list despite their virtual dominance in the recent past, including a 1-2 in the 2012 preseason poll. Other schools like Point Loma Nazarene (Calif.), Southern Nazarene (Okla.), Shorter (Ga.) and Trevecca Nazarene (Tenn.) surely would have appeared in the Top 50 as well, had they not been in the transition to the ranks of the NCAA.\nTo compile the list, I started with Massey’s ratings. As for how accurate the computer is when it comes to NAIA women’s basketball, I have not the foggiest clue. So if you see a team left off the list that should be there, the Massey Ratings are the first place I’d look to try to decipher why the team is omitted.\nI went ahead and drew the list out to the Top 50, however the numbers indicate many in the bottom 1/3 could be reasonably moved up or down, or replaced by other worthy programs. Particularly with the lower portion of the list, I have not much (or sometimes not at all) knowledge at all of the programs. But the numbers put them there, and who doesn’t like to see their names on a fun list? I’ve added comments on some teams based on facts gleaned from the 2011 NAIA tournament press book or first-hand knowledge.\nThe first number you’ll see listed on each school is the program’s overall score by my maths, followed by Massey’s 2011 computerized preseason rating. If the team is ranked in the current preseason Top 25, that will be listed third. The numbers are there so perhaps you can gauge the distance between programs. Or you might use the numbers to see how their recent history program number correlates to their 2012 projections. Other than that, the numbers are probably there so you can see that, yes indeed, I used numbers to compile the list (despite my homerism for #2, OCU).\nFor context and reference there are 271 NAIA member institutions (including those in transition elsewhere) and 112 of these schools participate in NAIA Division I women’s basketball and are listed on the 2011-12 posteason qualification plan.
