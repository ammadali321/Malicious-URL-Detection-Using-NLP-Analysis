In September of the year 1728, King George II issued a Royal Patent in Virginia Colony which gave James Jr. and Jeremiah Mize 118 acres of land joining the river and the Stony Creek. Here is how the land was described: The Mize land ran from the mouth of Ruine Creek (same as Stony Creek),up the creek as it meandered to a beech, then the line crossed the creek...east...north to a pine, then east...south...to a corner hickory, then east..north..to the Little Creek, then down the creek as it meandered to the river, and up the river to the start.

Mize&amp;#39;s letter, some believed the family was French, spelled Mise or Myes. On 11/09/1784, Joshua received a grant for 150 acres. In 1786 Isaac Mize was a young farmer in Surry County in the Yadkin Valley of northewestern North Carolina. Many of his relatives had come from the southside of Virginia a generation earlier. IsaacÂ had a strong desire to go west. With his wife Elizabeth and five children he moved to the frontier across Madison County. Here he settled in the Kentucky County of Virginia in newly-established Madison County. Here the Kentucky River emerges from its headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains and enter the eastern part of the attractive and fertile Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Isaac Mize spent the remaing 33 years of his life in the part of Madison County that became Estill County a year before he died in 1809. A bible record of one of his grandsons gives names and dates of birth of 12 children, 10 of whom (5 boys, 5 girls) survived infancy. Two of the boys, Joshua and Isaac, remained in Estill County to become substantial citizens. William went to Logan Co. KY where some of his descendants still live. David went to Logan Co. then to Pike Co., Illinois where he died in 1831. Four of his sons and a daughter migrated to Texas before the Civil War, where they have numerous descendantsï»¿.Â Â 1-Isaac Mize Sr 1750apx D: 1809 M: Elizabeth Taylor.

Henry seems to have been a man who was always ready to make a dime, and was quiet good at it. There was a famous Civil War battle fought at the home of Henry and Ruth and is written in books that can be found in the local Library&amp;#39;s. Ruth refused to leave her home when the North came and took over her house. She stayed inside with some of her small children and the Northern Troops. The next morning a battle was fought between Cox&amp;#39;s Army and the Flat Top Copperheads, captained by theÂ famous Richard Foley. One can only guess at what Ruth had to say to the Union Troop&amp;#39;s. She had to be a very brave lady to stay and face the Union Troop&amp;#39;s without Henry there to back her up. I am sure that they were more than happy to depart her home the next morning, and the fight with Richard Foley and his Copperheads had to be mild to what she had put them through. She is a lady to be admired by all of her descendants, men and women. She is also a good example for our young girls today. I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder how many of us would be as brave? I have also wondered where Henry was, that Ruth was in the home alone except for her small children? Could he have gone into the nearby mountains to warn Capt. Richard Foley? It is very likely that he did and was unable to get back, or he could have fought with the Copperheads. When the State of West Virginia tore down and burned the Clark home to make a new road, Josiah Carl Clark says there were balls still in bedded it the logs from the battle fought there in 1862. It would have been nice if the State could or would have saved the home as an Historical building. Maybe too, I only wish for this because they were my great great grandparents. Henry and Ruth came to this area in 1842 according to their son, Henry, Jr. They first bought property in Wyoming Co. Virginia, then sometime before 1860 they sold that to a William Clark (don&amp;#39;t know what relation, but am sure there is one) and bought the property in Camp Creek where they lived out their lives. Henry gave the property to their son John and lived there with him until he died sometime before 1890.&amp;quot;Â 4~Sampson Mize B: 1811 VA D: 06/29/1854 VA M: 1830 Elizabeth Stone, VA Remarried 01/02/1855 to Nancy Clark B: 1833Â 5~Rachel Mize B: 1815 VA M: 11/06/1834 to Thomas Martin VAÂ 6~Flemming Mize B: 1817 VA M: 05/04/1834 to Mary Ann Anglin, VAÂ 7~John Marshall Mize B: 09/17/1819 D: 02/17/1855 MSÂ  M: 05/04/1840 to Martha Ann Anglin B: 09/23/1822 D:1~Quincy A.

In September of the year 1728, King George II issued a Royal Patent in Virginia Colony which gave James Jr. and Jeremiah Mize 118 acres of land joining the river and the Stony Creek. Here is how the land was described: The Mize land ran from the mouth of Ruine Creek (same as Stony Creek),up the creek as it meandered to a beech, then the line crossed the creek...east...north to a pine, then east...south...to a corner hickory, then east..north..to the Little Creek, then down the creek as it meandered to the river, and up the river to the start.

Mize&#39;s letter, some believed the family was French, spelled Mise or Myes. On 11/09/1784, Joshua received a grant for 150 acres. In 1786 Isaac Mize was a young farmer in Surry County in the Yadkin Valley of northewestern North Carolina. Many of his relatives had come from the southside of Virginia a generation earlier. Isaac&nbsp;had a strong desire to go west. With his wife Elizabeth and five children he moved to the frontier across Madison County. Here he settled in the Kentucky County of Virginia in newly-established Madison County. Here the Kentucky River emerges from its headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains and enter the eastern part of the attractive and fertile Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Isaac Mize spent the remaing 33 years of his life in the part of Madison County that became Estill County a year before he died in 1809. A bible record of one of his grandsons gives names and dates of birth of 12 children, 10 of whom (5 boys, 5 girls) survived infancy. Two of the boys, Joshua and Isaac, remained in Estill County to become substantial citizens. William went to Logan Co. KY where some of his descendants still live. David went to Logan Co. then to Pike Co., Illinois where he died in 1831. Four of his sons and a daughter migrated to Texas before the Civil War, where they have numerous descendantsï»¿.&nbsp;&nbsp;1-Isaac Mize Sr 1750apx D: 1809 M: Elizabeth Taylor.

Henry seems to have been a man who was always ready to make a dime, and was quiet good at it. There was a famous Civil War battle fought at the home of Henry and Ruth and is written in books that can be found in the local Library&#39;s. Ruth refused to leave her home when the North came and took over her house. She stayed inside with some of her small children and the Northern Troops. The next morning a battle was fought between Cox&#39;s Army and the Flat Top Copperheads, captained by the&nbsp;famous Richard Foley. One can only guess at what Ruth had to say to the Union Troop&#39;s. She had to be a very brave lady to stay and face the Union Troop&#39;s without Henry there to back her up. I am sure that they were more than happy to depart her home the next morning, and the fight with Richard Foley and his Copperheads had to be mild to what she had put them through. She is a lady to be admired by all of her descendants, men and women. She is also a good example for our young girls today. I can&#39;t help but wonder how many of us would be as brave? I have also wondered where Henry was, that Ruth was in the home alone except for her small children? Could he have gone into the nearby mountains to warn Capt. Richard Foley? It is very likely that he did and was unable to get back, or he could have fought with the Copperheads. When the State of West Virginia tore down and burned the Clark home to make a new road, Josiah Carl Clark says there were balls still in bedded it the logs from the battle fought there in 1862. It would have been nice if the State could or would have saved the home as an Historical building. Maybe too, I only wish for this because they were my great great grandparents. Henry and Ruth came to this area in 1842 according to their son, Henry, Jr. They first bought property in Wyoming Co. Virginia, then sometime before 1860 they sold that to a William Clark (don&#39;t know what relation, but am sure there is one) and bought the property in Camp Creek where they lived out their lives. Henry gave the property to their son John and lived there with him until he died sometime before 1890.&quot;&nbsp;4~Sampson Mize B: 1811 VA D: 06/29/1854 VA M: 1830 Elizabeth Stone, VA Remarried 01/02/1855 to Nancy Clark B: 1833&nbsp;5~Rachel Mize B: 1815 VA M: 11/06/1834 to Thomas Martin VA&nbsp;6~Flemming Mize B: 1817 VA M: 05/04/1834 to Mary Ann Anglin, VA&nbsp;7~John Marshall Mize B: 09/17/1819 D: 02/17/1855 MS&nbsp; M: 05/04/1840 to Martha Ann Anglin B: 09/23/1822 D:1~Quincy A.

Per John A. Mize&#39;s letter, some believed the family was French, spelled Mise or Myes. On 11/09/1784, Joshua received a grant for 150 acres. In 1786 Isaac Mize was a young farmer in Surry County in the Yadkin Valley of northewestern North Carolina. Many of his relatives had come from the southside of Virginia a generation earlier. Isaac&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; font-size: 10pt;" style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; font-size: 10pt;">had a strong desire to go west. With his wife Elizabeth and five children he moved to the frontier across Madison County. Here he settled in the Kentucky County of Virginia in newly-established Madison County. Here the Kentucky River emerges from its headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains and enter the eastern part of the attractive and fertile Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Isaac Mize spent the remaing 33 years of his life in the part of Madison County that became Estill County a year before he died in 1809. A bible record of one of his grandsons gives names and dates of birth of 12 children, 10 of whom (5 boys, 5 girls) survived infancy. Two of the boys, Joshua and Isaac, remained in Estill County to become substantial citizens. William went to Logan Co. KY where some of his descendants still live. David went to Logan Co. then to Pike Co., Illinois where he died in 1831. Four of his sons and a daughter migrated to Texas before the Civil War, where they have numerous descendantsï»¿.&nbsp;</span></p>

Henry seems to have been a man who was always ready to make a dime, and was quiet good at it. </span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;">There was a famous Civil War battle fought at the home of Henry and Ruth and is written in books that can be found in the local Library&#39;s. Ruth refused to leave her home when the North came and took over her house. She stayed inside with some of her small children and the Northern Troops. The next morning a battle was fought between Cox&#39;s Army and the Flat Top Copperheads, captained by the&nbsp;</span></span><span data-mce-style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;">famous Richard Foley. </span><span data-mce-style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;">One can only guess at what Ruth had to say to the Union Troop&#39;s. She had to be a very brave lady to stay and face the Union Troop&#39;s without Henry there to back her up. I am sure that they were more than happy to depart her home the next morning, and the fight with Richard Foley and his Copperheads had to be mild to what she had put them through. She is a lady to be admired by all of her descendants, men and women. She is also a good example for our young girls today. I can&#39;t help but wonder how many of us would be as brave? I have also wondered where Henry was, that Ruth was in the home alone except for her small children? Could he have gone into the nearby mountains to warn Capt. Richard Foley? It is very likely that he did and was unable to get back, or he could have fought with the Copperheads. When the State of West Virginia tore down and burned the Clark home to make a new road, Josiah Carl Clark says there were balls still in bedded it the logs from the battle fought there in 1862. It would have been nice if the State could or would have saved the home as an Historical building. Maybe too, I only wish for this because they were my great great grandparents. </span><span data-mce-style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="font-family: times, 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;">Henry and Ruth came to this area in 1842 according to their son, Henry, Jr. They first bought property in Wyoming Co. Virginia, then sometime before 1860 they sold that to a William Clark (don&#39;t know what relation, but am sure there is one) and bought the property in Camp Creek where they lived out their lives. Henry gave the property to their son John and lived there with him until he died sometime before 1890.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

He possessed many of the same attributes of Green Clay, in that he too was a soldier, politician and an entrepreneur. He was the county&#39;s most influential citizen during the critical period prior to and during the Civil War.&nbsp; He, like Clay, left his imprint on the Estill County as well.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;" id="yui_3_7_2_1_1394060640538_2651" style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Sidney was born in 1821 to John Harris Barnes and Lucy Grubbs.&nbsp; John and Lucy Barnes, while still in their twenties, died when one of the frequent Typhoid Fever epidemics struck Irvine in 1823/24. At the death of their parents, Sidney and his younger brother Thomas Barnes, were sent to live with an uncle in Montgomery County.&nbsp; Thomas Grubbs was a farmer and insisted that his eldest nephew become a farmer. However Sidney was interested in following his father into the legal profession.&nbsp; When he reached the age of eighteen he rebelled against his uncle and returned to Irvine to pursue a career in law. According to granddaughter, Maude Barnes Miller, Sidney&rsquo;s net assets when he arrived in his native county were a horse, a dollar and a watch.&nbsp; Sidney did odd jobs around the courthouse while his father&rsquo;s old friend, Judge Burnham, tutored him in law.&nbsp; After completing his legal training, he became one of Estill County&rsquo;s most successful attorneys for the next three decades.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;" id="yui_3_7_2_1_1394060640538_2652" style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">In 1841, Sidney married Elizabeth Mize, daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth Mize.&nbsp; Isaac Mize was a wealthy landowner whose holdings included the well known spa, Estill Springs.&nbsp; Sidney and Elizabeth had six children, several of whom became prominent in their own right.&nbsp; Their eldest son, Thomas Harris Barnes, left Centre College after the outbreak of the Civil War to become one of the youngest persons ever promoted to the rank of Major in the U S Army. In later life he was appointed Prosecuting Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas by President McKinley. Another son, James Keith Barnes served as postmaster of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The house that James Keith Barnes constructed while living in Fort Smith has recently been given museum status by the Arkansas Heritage Commission.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;" id="yui_3_7_2_1_1394060640538_2654" style="line-height: normal; color: black; font-size: 10pt;">When the Civil War erupted, Sidney rallied to the side of the Union. He was the prime force in the formation of the famous Eighth Kentucky Infantry Regiment.&nbsp; The regiment was comprised mostly of men from Estill and her neighboring counties.&nbsp; The soldiers earned national acclaim for their heroic efforts in capturing the crest of Lookout Mountain in that celebrated battle.&nbsp; The names of Sidney and several of his subordinates are enshrined on a plaque atop the precipice. Sidney&rsquo;s plantation at Estill Springs became the training base for the Eighth Infantry while the regiment was being assembled.&nbsp; Sidney had acquired the estate from his father-in-law just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War.&nbsp; Barnes was given a Colonel&rsquo;s commission and assumed command of the regiment.&nbsp; As commanding officer, he is credited for much of the success achieved by the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: times,times new roman"><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: ; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was in the Yadkin Valley in western North Carolina that our forefather, Joshua Mize, lived during the year 1784. Yadkin Valley is located in present Wilkes County, North Carolina, near the eastern face of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was in this remote area that the family of Joshua and his wife Patty lived. This was approximately 30 miles from the Boone Family settlement. </span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: ; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Squire Boone, the father of Daniel Boone bought land close to Holman&#39;s Ford located on the North Fork of the Yadkin Valley in present day Davidson County, North Carolina. Squire had traveled from Berks County, Pennsylvania between the years 1751 and 1752 to North Carolina. The Boone family had married several times into the John Lincoln family of Berk&#39;s County, Pennsylvania. John Lincoln&#39;s grandson, Abraham Lincoln (grandfather of the President Abraham Lincoln), moved through Virginia into Kentucky, through Cumberland Gap via the Wilderness Trail. Because of this, our Mize family can claim being related to President Abraham Lincoln albeit only distantly. </span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: ; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Squire Boone fathered several children but there are three sons which are pertinent to the Boone/Mize connection. They were Samuel, George, and Daniel. Daniel married Rebecca Bryan, whose family was a neighbor to the Boones, during the year 1756. During the year 1759 he bought 640 acres from his father George Boone to live on. Just five years later, he sold this land and moved farther up the Yadkin Valley located in Wilkes County, North Carolina in 1769. During the same time frame, there was major discontent between the British government and the colonial settlers. A vigilante group named the Regulators regularly fought the the British government troops and the government because of their oppressive policies. Violence was a common occurrence filtering through the valley during the Revolution War. Back to 1769, Daniel Boone was recruited as a scout for an expedition through the Cumberland Gap and up into the region where the Kentucky River and the Licking River are located. This expedition established a base at the adjunct of present day Estill, Powell and Clark counties on the Red River. It was during this expedition, that Boone visited a buffalo wallow near the Red River which was named Estill Springs which is close to the present day town of Irvine. Irvine is where the Isaac Mize family settled. Daniel helped to establish the Wilderness Road during the year 1774 and he ultimately established Fort Boonesboro in late 1775. He brought his family from the Yadkin Valley in North Carolina to Fort Boonesboro settlement on the banks of the Kentucky River. Daniel had several children but of specific importance were Elizabeth, William L. and Squire. </span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: ; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Nancy Grubbs, married William L. Boone on 16 August 1789 in Madison County, Kentucky. Remember Lucy Grubbs? Well she married John Barnes and they had a son named Sidney M. Barnes. Sidney Barnes was a very respected lawyer of Estill County, Kentucky and became very involved in politics. He bought four hundred acres of land at Estill Springs located in Estill County&#39; Kentucky along with enough slaves to farm the land and attend his family. He was a southerner at heart but ultimately held the Union cause during the Civil War. He became the Colonel of the 8th Kentucky Volunteer Infantry which he raised and trained on his land at Estill Springs. After the Civil War, he served as a Representative in the Kentucky House of Representatives during 1848 and later ran for Governor during 1867 which he subsequently lost the election. He then moved to Arkansas where he became a delegate in the 1874 Constitutional Convention. He was nominated and appointed as the U.S. District Attorney for the Territory of New Mexico. Sidney and his wife spent their last days in Carthage, Missouri. </span><span data-mce-style="line-height: normal; font-size: 10pt;" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: ; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Joshua Mize who had lived in North Carolina, fathered a son, Isaac, which married an Elizabeth. That union between Isaac (Sr) and Elizabeth produced a son named Isaac (Jr) who married Nancy Walker. The marriage between Isaac and Nancy produced a daughter named Elizabeth. So far, so good. Remember Sidney Barnes? Sidney married Elizabeth, the daughter of Isaac (Jr) Mize and Nancy Walker. This is the connection from the Mize family to the Grubbs family which in turn connects to Boone family.</span></span></p>

<p class="bio" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; FONT-FAMILY: times,times new roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Long story short....The Boones married into the Grubbs family. Sidney M. Barnes, the son of Lucy Grubbs and John Barnes, married Elizabeth Mize, the daughter of Isaac Mize and Nancy Walker! We are related but only distantly to Boone Family and still even more distantly to the Lincoln Family.</span></p>
