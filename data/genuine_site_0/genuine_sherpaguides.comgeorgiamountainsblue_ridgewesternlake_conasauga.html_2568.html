<h2>Lake Conasauga </h2>
<p>
  Seventeen-acre Lake Conasauga [<a href="map_cohutta_wilderness_trails.html" target="_blank">Fig. 
  14</a>(17)], located at 3,150 feet, near the summit of Grassy Mountain, is the 
  highest lake in Georgia. The name &quot;Conasauga&quot; is derived from the 
  Cherokee word <i>kahnasagah</i>, meaning &quot;grass,&quot; &quot;sparkling 
  water,&quot; or &quot;strong horse,&quot; according to various sources. Grassy 
  Mountain, at 3,682 feet, is one of the higher mountains in the area, and the 
  grassy Ball Field is nearby. 

<p>
  Conasauga River and Lake Conasauga do indeed sparkle. The river has been compared 
  to a strong horse because it overflowed its banks and flooded after heavy rain. 
  Whatever the source of the name, a river, lake, and several Indian settlements 
  in the area are called &quot;Conasauga.&quot; 

<p>
  Lake Conasauga, the picnic area, and U.S. Forest Service roads 17, 18, and 68 
  were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the administration 
  of Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

<p>
  A fully developed Forest Service campground is available. The 35 campsites have 
  tent pads. Restrooms and cold running water are centrally located. Most of the 
  sites are not on the lake, but are very close. This is a heavily used campground, 
  and on busy summer weekends it is likely to be full. There is an overflow camping 
  area. No water is available but there are portable toilets. The group camping 
  area is a large grassy field without tables, grills, or water. 

<p>
  The entire recreation area is accessible from the day-use area, which has a 
  restroom, water, tables, grills, two covered shelters, and a parking lot. The 
  large, heavily used but rarely full picnic area offers quiet solitude a short 
  walk from the car. Food and equipment must be carried to the picnic tables and 
  shelters that are some distance from the parking area. At the lake there is 
  a developed swimming area with a pea-gravel bottom and a dock. There is no beach 
  for sunbathing, but a pleasant, grassy ledge instead. Swimming is restricted 
  to the marked swimming area. The water remains cool most of the summer, though 
  by July 4 it is quite comfortable. 

<p>
  Off the picnic road is a boat ramp and parking lot access road. The lake is 
  limited to electric motors, rowing, and paddling. It is a great place to canoe 
  or raft. 

<p>
  Although the lake is heavily fished, some very large bass live in the deeps. 
  Rainbow trout are stocked, and good populations of bream are also present.

<p>
  [<a href="map_cohutta_wilderness_trails.html" target="_blank">Fig. 14</a>(17)] 
  This is a Song Bird Management Area, where the trees and other vegetation are 
  managed to provide the best bird habitat. Over 100 species of birds have been 
  seen. These include hawks, owls, woodpeckers, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, warblers, 
  cuckoos, phoebes, flycatchers, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, brown creepers, 
  wrens, tanagers, grosbeaks, indigo buntings, and red crossbills. A checklist 
  of the birds is available from the Cohutta Ranger District Office. 

<p>
  Like most of Georgia's highlands, the elevation, climate, vegetation, and nesting 
  birds of Lake Conasauga are similar to those in Pennsylvania. Georgia's mountains 
  are the approximate southern limit for Eastern hemlock and Eastern white pine. 
  This is an excellent area in which to see a wide range of trees, shrubs, herbs, 
  and flowers representative of the southern highlands, including the yellow and 
  black birch and mountain camellias. A plant list is also available from the 
  ranger district office.

<h3> Hiking<a name="Hiking"></a> Trails Around Lake Conasauga </h3>
<p>
  <b>LAKE<a name="LAKE"></a> CONASAUGA TRAIL.</b> 1.2-mile loop. An easy walk 
  around the lake, passing through tunnels of rhododendron and crossing picturesque 
  bridges. Interesting ferns, wildflowers, shrubs, trees, birds, and scenic views 
  of the lake are found along the trail. 

<p>
  <b>GRASSY<a name="GRASSY"></a> MOUNTAIN TOWER TRAIL</b>. 2 miles. From the dam 
  on Lake Conasauga to the old fire tower atop Grassy Mountain, this trail makes 
  an easy ascent along the ridge. To the west are excellent views of the wilderness 
  and valley. 

<p>
  <b>SONGBIRD<a name="SONGBIRD"></a> TRAIL.</b> 1.7-mile loop. This trail begins 
  at the overflow, then runs along a small brook and around a beaver swamp through 
  the Songbird Management Area, a series of clear-cuts which provide a variety 
  of vegetation valuable to many songbirds. 

<p>
  Interpretive signs explaining songbird habitats lead hikers around the trail. 
  Nature walks are offered on certain weekends between Memorial Day and Labor 
  Day. 

<h3> The Conasauga River<a name="conriver"></a> </h3>
<p>
  [<a href="map_cohutta_wilderness_trails.html" target="_blank">Fig. 14</a>] The 
  Conasauga River is born deep in the Cohutta Wilderness. From its inception, 
  it flows north through a series of rapids through almost inaccessible steep 
  gorges before reaching the Alaculsy Valley. Here it appears to rest for a couple 
  of miles before its confluence with the Jacks River. This upper section offers 
  beautiful scenery and rough-country hiking. 

<p>
  Considered uncanoeable by most, at very high water levels the upper section 
  provides a few hardy souls a wild-water experience hard to beat. The section 
  beginning where the Conasauga leaves the valley at its confluence with the Jacks 
  is more suited to recreational paddling. Here the river turns westward to cut 
  across several ridges before bending south to join the Coosawattee and eventually 
  become part of the Coosa River system. 

<p>
  This is a crystal-clear mountain stream which during the summer lacks sufficient 
  water for easy navigation by canoe. On the section below the Jacks River confluence, 
  most of the rapids are intricate Class I or Class II mazes&#151;excellent water 
  to help sharpen water-reading skills. There is one Class III rapid thrown into 
  the middle of the run to keep paddlers alert on this exceptionally scenic river. 

<p>
  The Conasauga is normally high enough to run during the winter and spring months. 
  Even at these higher levels it will remain clear. Since this river rises rapidly 
  in times of flooding, avoid putting in if it is cloudy and turbid. There are 
  no specific hazards for intermediate or advanced canoeists, although the one 
  Class III rapid could cause problems for less-experienced paddlers. Cold-weather 
  paddling trips are for experienced groups only. Full wet-suit protection and 
  complete safety and first-aid gear are essential. 

<ul>
  <li> <b>Directions:</b> Travel north on US 411 over the Georgia state line. 
    The Conasauga River bridge, which is the take-out point, is just a couple 
    of miles across the line in Tennessee. To travel to the put-in, continue north 
    on US 411 to the first paved road on the right next to a service station. 
    This is Sheeds Creak Road; turn right. The pavement soon ends, but the roadbed 
    is solid and will present no problems. Follow this same road for about 7 miles 
    over several ridges until it drops down into a small valley. Several camping 
    areas as well as the river will be visible on the right, followed by a large 
    steel bridge. This is the Jacks River Bridge and marks the confluence of the 
    Jacks and Conasauga rivers. There are several good launch sites in this area.
