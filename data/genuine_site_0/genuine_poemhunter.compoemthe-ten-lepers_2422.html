He yearned too fondly over the erring sons of men, Even sharing in their sorrows, though He joined not in their feasts,— So He kindly told the Lepers: “Show yourselves unto the priests.”   When, miracle of mercy! as they turned them to obey, And towards the Holy Temple quickly took their hopeful way, Lo! the hideous scales fell off them, health’s fountains were unsealed, Their skin grew soft as infant’s—their leprosy was healed.   O man! so oft an ingrate, to thy thankless nature true, Thyself see in those Lepers, who did as thou dost do; Nine went their way rejoicing, healed in body—glad in soul— Nor once thought of returning thanks to Him who made them whole.   One only, a Samaritan, a stranger to God’s word, Felt his joyous, panting bosom, with gratitude deep stirred, And without delay he hastened, in the dust, at Jesus’ feet, To cast himself in worship, in thanksgiving, warm and meet.   Slowly questioned him the Saviour, with majesty divine:— “Ten were cleansed from their leprosy—where are the other nine? Is there none but this one stranger—unlearned in Gods ways, His name and mighty power, to give word of thanks or praise?”   The sunbeams’ quivering glories softly touched that God-like head, The olives blooming round Him sweet shade and fragrance shed, While o’er His sacred features a tender sadness stole: “Rise, go thy way,” He murmured, “thy faith hath made thee whole!”"

’Neath the olives of Samaria, in far-famed Galilee,<br/>Where dark green vines are mirrored in a placid silver sea,<br/>’Mid scenes of tranquil beauty, glowing sun-sets, rosy dawn,<br/>The Master and disciples to the city journeyed on. <br/><br/>And, as they neared a valley where a sheltered hamlet lay,<br/>A strange, portentous wailing made them pause upon their way—<br/>Voices fraught with anguish, telling of aching heart and brow,<br/>Which kept moaning: “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us now!” <br/><br/>Softly raised the gentle Saviour His eyes like midnight star,<br/>And His mournful gaze soon rested on ten lepers, who, afar,<br/>Stood motionless and suppliant, in sackcloth rudely clothed,<br/>Poor Pariahs! by their nearest, their dearest, shunned and loathed. <br/><br/>Not unto Him prayed vainly those sore afflicted ten,<br/>No! He yearned too fondly over the erring sons of men,<br/>Even sharing in their sorrows, though He joined not in their feasts,—<br/>So He kindly told the Lepers: “Show yourselves unto the priests.” <br/><br/>When, miracle of mercy! as they turned them to obey,<br/>And towards the Holy Temple quickly took their hopeful way,<br/>Lo! the hideous scales fell off them, health’s fountains were unsealed,<br/>Their skin grew soft as infant’s—their leprosy was healed. <br/><br/>O man! so oft an ingrate, to thy thankless nature true,<br/>Thyself see in those Lepers, who did as thou dost do;<br/>Nine went their way rejoicing, healed in body—glad in soul—<br/>Nor once thought of returning thanks to Him who made them whole. <br/><br/>One only, a Samaritan, a stranger to God’s word,<br/>Felt his joyous, panting bosom, with gratitude deep stirred,<br/>And without delay he hastened, in the dust, at Jesus’ feet,<br/>To cast himself in worship, in thanksgiving, warm and meet. <br/><br/>Slowly questioned him the Saviour, with majesty divine:—<br/>“Ten were cleansed from their leprosy—where are the other nine?<br/>Is there none but this one stranger—unlearned in Gods ways,<br/>His name and mighty power, to give word of thanks or praise?” <br/><br/>The sunbeams’ quivering glories softly touched that God-like head,<br/>The olives blooming round Him sweet shade and fragrance shed,<br/>While o’er His sacred features a tender sadness stole:<br/>“Rise, go thy way,” He murmured, “thy faith hath made thee whole!”                </p>
