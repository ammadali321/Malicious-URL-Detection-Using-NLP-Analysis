<BLOCKQUOTE>"The digital road warriors kit - laptop, cell phone, PDA, and 
  pager - is just capable enough to bother you everywhere without necessarily 
  helping you anywhere. Its absurd that each device is still on such poor 
  speaking terms with the others. We walk around like pack horses saddled with 
  information appliances. We should be in the saddle, not under it."

<P>During the autumn of 1999 and the winter of 2000 I wrote my diploma thesis to 
complete my "sivilingeniør"-studies (degree comparable to Master of 
Science).</P>
<P>I was fortunate enough to get to work with a subject that was then and even 
still remains reasonably bleeding-edge; wearable computers.</P>
<P>Using the Mobile Assistant 4 version of the <A 
href="http://www.xybernaut.com/">Xybernaut</A>, I was allowed to play at the 
technology labs of a major technology consulting company in the south of France. 
A dream come true for a geeky technology student... :-)</P>
<P>The same company kindly paid my trip to and attendance at the International 
Conference on Wearable Computers in Stuttgart, Germany in 1999. There, I met 
wearable superstar <A href="http://www.wearcam.org/">Steve Mann</A>, and many 
other knowledgeable and helpful persons. I thank you all, and should you read 
this today, please get in touch (business cards disappear over time :-/ )</P>
<P>If you want to have a read through the thesis, the URL is </P>

<P>If you actually take some time to read it in full or in part, I would greatly 
appreciate your feedback, one word or more, either through posting comments at <a href="http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2002/12/10/wearable_computers_thesis_publication.html">this page</a> or by any other means you prefer (AIM, ICQ, physical mail etc :-)</P>
<P>For the casual reader, I recommend a look at chapter 8 - <I>Changing the 
rules of the game: Social Impact of Wearable computers</I>, chapter 9 - 
<I>Ubiquitous Computing</I> and the conclusions of chapter 12-13, most of which 
should still be relevant...</P>
