<center><h1>Irish and Manx Names</h1></center>

These two countries are grouped together because the native language in
each was Gaelic.  However, it is important to note that there were other
cultures and languages in each country.  In some periods there were 
<a href="scandinavian.shtml">Norse</a>
communities in each country, and later 
<a href="english.shtml">English</a>
communities.  Members of each culture had names constructed according to
their own customs, which slowly blended with the native naming customs in
some ways.  The articles listed below cover both Gaelic and non-Gaelic
names in these lands.

certainly been translated and normalized.  Some

patronymics that can easily be mistaken for double given names. Other
