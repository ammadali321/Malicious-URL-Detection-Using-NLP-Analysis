Claude Perier was one of the first directors of the Bank of France. Three of his eight sons, Casimir (1777–1832), Scipion (1776–1821) and Joseph (1786–1866) were in the forefront of business and finance during the Bourbon Restoration. The family moved to Paris after the revolution of Thermidor&nbsp;(1794), and Casimir joined the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("58178",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("58178")' href="/topics/Army_of_Italy_(France)">army of Italy</a><span class="hp" id="m58178"><div class="hpHeader">Army of Italy (France)</div><div class="hpContent">The Army of Italy  was a Field army of the French Army stationed on the Italian border and used for operations in Italy itself.

<br />
On his father's death in 1801, Casimir Perier left the army and with his brother Scipion founded a bank in Paris, the speculations of which Casimir directed while Scipion took on its administration. Joseph Perier became a partner in 1822. Two of the most important clients of the bank were the Anzin Mining Company, the leading coal mining firm in northern France, and the Perier foundry at Chaillot, purchased by Scipion Perier in 1818 and famous for its manufacture of early steam engines. In 1818 the Perier brothers were instrumental in the establishment in Paris of the first French savings bank. In 1821 Casimir Perier became chairman of the board of directors of the Anzin Mining Company; and in that same year he succeeded his brother Scipion as a director of the Bank of France. During the 1820s the Perier bank invested in the canal construction program in France. In 1825 the bank helped sponsor an attempt at joint stock investment banking,the <i>Societe Commanditaire de l'Industrie</i>,for mining, metallurgy, canal construction and land development. Casimir Perier's wide-ranging business interests and investments help to explain his opposition in the Chamber of Deputies to financial policies of Restoration ministries. He opposed, for example, the ruinous methods by which the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("7550",this,"armand-emmanuel_du_plessis,_duc_de_richelieu.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("7550")' href="/topics/Armand-Emmanuel_du_Plessis,_Duc_de_Richelieu">duc de Richelieu</a><span class="hp" id="m7550"><div class="hpHeader">Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i7550"></div>Armand Emmanuel Sophie Septimanie de Vignerot du Plessis, 5th Duke of Richelieu  was a prominent French statesman during the Bourbon Restoration...</div><br></span>&nbsp;sought to raise the war indemnity demanded by the Allies, in a pamphlet <i>Réflexions sur le projet d'emprunt</i> (1817), followed in the same year by <i>Dernières réflexions</i> in answer to an inspired article in the <i>Moniteur</i>.<br />
